So some of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best, and we have to put the systems on their site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care, or the one thing to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social choices, any kind of decision that you need to take away from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having a high cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most important drugs in the world today, you know, you may know that you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for which most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have a surgery on any medical procedure before you help a person.
And it must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a <unk> and if it's a <unk> it's about the scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
insults, 300.
This on the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently <unk>
I am <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or a brain event or another <unk>
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 to go down my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the prescription of all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, <unk> the <unk> effects. Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "People five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
You remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to look at it over time, so you don't have to make the string chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of your exposure for the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic does it need, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men in the age of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of the <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make that we get the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life on pain, or a longer life that could have a lot longer to the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they shut out a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> in the face of a predator, you don't need the immune system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get lunch of lions, so nothing of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is rational, as Danny <unk> and their colleagues have been shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future of how those <unk> could be like to put the systems into the place that will help you minimize the damage, or to avoid the bad things happening in the first place.
He went on to the snow night in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I haven't had, and lots of text messages I haven't read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more softly.
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> it may have never been able to make a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the sign system, the <unk> in addition to a little story.
The French signs came in during the 1800s, and over the time was mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know today like <unk>
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound go?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are kind of like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, making sure you don't <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
All of this I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
It was going to be <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines are already sounds through the subtle and subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to do this with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that I called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my art <unk>
Am I going to ask me more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know sound.
I know it so well that it's not just experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> a social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt the sound was <unk> it was a <unk> thing.
And the sound is so powerful that I could get it to me and my artistic job, or I could be <unk>
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture of <unk> language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just as well and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a time of value for something like taking a loan out of a very high interest.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in the forget and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be capture and expressing fully on the role.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in <unk>
The two are very lightweight and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals as the sound.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to figure out how it works the <unk>
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divided into many different ways.
If you give a different parameter if you take a different parameter for each finger, while the piano, like the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you put it only one key at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in order to express a concept of clear or an idea in <unk>
If only one button would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing is true of the music in terms of and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Ah, I was <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the <unk> <unk>
If I had to create a sign and take it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign and <unk>
This is all day."
If you go through it, and you <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to you as well."
All tonight."
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time.
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand <unk> <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> limb <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to teach you a form of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands.
Now we're going to do it both in the head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages all over the world.
The second thing I would like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please let me again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. but they make a very different meanings on it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and rich, like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to learn -- you don't have to hear the music.
<unk> is a rich treasure.
I would like to show you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And they never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination was taken me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to protect us from the horrific truth.
When I got older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning each other.
Time country, I'm now an adult and teaching civil citizenship and the invention of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, I <unk> the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I didn't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and they collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and they <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive, and it's also very <unk> to use those huge boats out.
So along with my students, six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We have transformed our tiny room in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this <unk> of <unk> <unk> so that young kids can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are very cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
We do.
I'll leave you with my students' imagination.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take an image of this <unk> the children get a lot of a lot of a lot of the <unk>
And then we created what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And it turns out the light lamps and web cameras and put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the plastic bits floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board processing this picture and measure the size of every particle, to get an estimate of how many plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to solve them immediately.
<unk> my problem <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news, you get the Internet, and it was <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning a oil spill, just using hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
And they were really shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which enables you to see what is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> what can help us identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
<unk> a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started <unk> giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> crops -- crops in the east coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant, a nuclear power plant near the water.
And today, according to the age of a 300 metric tons are still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution for <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast disappeared from the Japanese coast and most of them -- it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research independently with other scientists, the land, the soil, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious job seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with their entire life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do afterwards, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a map of <unk> <unk> from the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this, we were able to notice that the radioactive dust will collapse from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system, and it <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But with this we organized an civil expedition -- the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom in to a mile of the nuclear power, and with the fishermen aid, we were collecting the sea bed <unk> with a <unk> tracking as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a remote problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try and solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turn it into the largest space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal metal, a little bit of biology -- basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with adult aid, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the elderly age transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens scientists, creators, <unk> must prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes and <unk> two radically opposite cultures of design.
One is made of thousands of steel parts, the other one of a silk string is made.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic thing.
One is convinced over the environment, the other thing I thought it is.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggles to be free.
The <unk> was only <unk>
But living creatures aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that was required for every cell to work and to make it up.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk> in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins skins is <unk> with little <unk>
One acts mainly as a filter, the other mainly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that spends gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect working on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, and the gene, between the machine, and the organism between the assembly and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and a <unk> shows on the two screens behind me.
My work, at the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly and getting up to growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about this 10 or even five years?
We live at a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they have four disciplines that offers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believe in.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, products, and tools and tools through scales, in a large scale, like this robotic arm with an scope of 24 feet in diameter with a ability that some day not very far printing to print <unk> buildings and graphics -- genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the archetype of the former Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where each crust is unique to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion video in Paris with <unk> they go <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing, <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> without <unk> between cells, I'll show more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials, and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
What designers have access to this high resolution and <unk> instruments, allowing us to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We have also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the same time, comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not by the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it is nature <unk>
There are no parts of nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God send the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there was no difference between trunk, sinister leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land has grown trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What is the design if the objects were made from a single shot.
Tell me a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material, the type of material of the tree <unk> and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced by organisms that are being produced by organisms.
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> shrimp, the <unk> and produced <unk>
We took the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot was able to vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one single material -- feet long, <unk>
When the pieces are lists, you dry them to dry it to find a natural way in contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with plastic <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that first first arose on the planet makes a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon out of the atmosphere, and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of beam in the mesh, and if it's spread even more, to windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made out of <unk> of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life and put in the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master the bacteria and control its flow.
So as the <unk> board, we made our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> form of biological form.
I like to think about synthetic biology -- like the liquid agency, just that instead of <unk> metals -- they were going to be able to make new gallbladder of biological backgrounds inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothing -- you know, two of them.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacterium that lives in the human intestine.
It turns out light in sugar, the other is consumed and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never got <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a unique channel that resembles the nasal tract that will help you have shown these bacteria and to make their function of the road.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as well as the mechanical functionality of the material.
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretches away from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our very <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are times in fashion -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase matter <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, to change the sun.
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is known in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly cohesive architecture in which they were <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers into each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first turn into the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of understanding better how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm worm <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk>
And yet, when we put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we can design these <unk> we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process into the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing <unk> of silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that <unk> <unk> toward the darker areas and that's why we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the ray of light and heat, confined the silk silk of the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk silk <unk> on a online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they are <unk> and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> they give all this pavilion that our integrity.
And rather than two or three weeks, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route of the silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is using robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to bring the products to the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, that leads to a design inspired by nature to a very inspired nature of design, which demands for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked this?
They can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art and he created the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of boredom, -- this feeling of, it's not a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I'm going to tell me about something else, something totally different, and I just let me get to <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that caused me so anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I would like to ask you then.
I know themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they knew it from culture.
You ask the first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would do to that age.
It's considered a naive way to make cute answers in kids like, <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students asked them to pick up at the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It is going to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
So if this is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired by dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does just happen the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and a creative name.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of manifest or true <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that get their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
It could help if you divide it into three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
And during the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the ideal of the Renaissance -- in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own own.
I think it seems like a kind of adapting to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or <unk> you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, visualizing data, traveling mathematics and design, when he found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of its unique idea of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
It comes from the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower is fast learning.
When we <unk> we are <unk> we are <unk>
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely started from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and an independent writer.
As a young pianist, an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I became a writer, <unk> it was financial <unk>
He had to learn the simplest sales mechanics when they started their practices and this ability helps to write a compelling number for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to have to do what you would tell you, even if the end of the <unk>
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you wouldn't have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other web designer, sometimes from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take on different roles -- depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine defines an adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to deal with the needs of the marketplace, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have to be right now, and we need creative thinkers not conventional molecular thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
They came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put ideas, and the <unk> gives a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we need to do with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to <unk> largely they are encouraging them to simply be more like their <unk>
And one time said that, if there's one thing you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with inner wiring -- whatever.
If you're a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I tell you, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep to the curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Would the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> they brought it to a psychiatric psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't even remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but I didn't know how to help me, but unfortunately, it passed away from <unk>
After his death, he was doing a autopsy. And they found strange and <unk> in the brain of <unk> in a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you had been alive today, we could not give her more help than the <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, a lot of treatments for cancer treatments, for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's kind of done on the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you in the way.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, you have to get Alzheimer's disease to be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend your years with Alzheimer's years or helping to take care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's.
Today is the most expensive disease and their costs -- a increase in five times in 2050, as we 2050, as the generation of <unk> booms <unk>
They may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little for <unk>
Now one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only ones that cannot be <unk> cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in disease despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's disease and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but everyone else is <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the time, the scientists, mistake Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there is only looking at a photo of a healthy brain compared to the <unk> of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage to see that disease.
In addition to unleashed a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's percent, significantly life expectancy is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds all right, these <unk> <unk> end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left on the outside.
So this makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as <unk> a bomb.
You know, a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that is blocked it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in their most part, they have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see it moving normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in a early stage, then we see that they <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But it grows that hope to beat the Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to get rid of Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we put it, we can <unk>
In the case of other disease, patients and their families have gotten more and more research pressure on government, industry pressure industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk to themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night -- they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for the change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the Italian column in the New York Times in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
And the article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience of it, I tested it one night in the past.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or ability, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time I went to another person?
And we <unk>
<unk> that are <unk> they are increasingly personal <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to tell your partner what you like to do, or it or she would be very honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say somebody you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited to all the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion to test this study, I had somebody who knew not particularly good at all.
And yet, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the silent column in a few months later.
That was published in January, and now I mean, I mean, I guess some of you probably wonder, do you keep together <unk>
And the reason I think this is because I have asked me this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before he was publishing the article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love of my blog.
But a blog blog can get a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand noticed.
And that took a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article ran on a Friday night, and already Saturday, this was on the traffic of my blog.
And on Sunday, I've already called the <unk> Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article received over eight million <unk> and I was like, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing with candor on own experiences, but another thing is to discover that life loving an international news has been an international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they did first the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed by radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of the readers by proving the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both did a public record together.
He had television interviews, and he refused to take the orders requests from us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons <unk> of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really happens, if I was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel like to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same studio in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher wasn't to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for foster interpersonal <unk> between university students -- using what he <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It sounds <unk> right?
But the study worked.
The participants were felt closer to doing that, several studies later -- they also used Iran's protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it among members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people in political political policies.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately they never get <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> I tried the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to tell you the person with whom they <unk>
Well, he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> I know they managed to get better to try and get the research better.
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation to it.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to read all my adulthood, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I'm going to focus on science.
And so I did know everything I could find about romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of hit the heart.
I don't know if I realized that at the moment I thought I just took for the book that I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was built with romantic love, I never would have to feel so bad and I used to feel like it then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in a way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what I am after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably to get to me.
What I'm looking for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told the media about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that asks you still together?
And his contents of the answer or No.
So more than a question, I would submit that let's make some more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your partner?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the brief version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago -- and we apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- <unk> love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, he hadn't considered everything that was supposed to do.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to take that decision, and how much of them will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, to have chosen to love somebody so generous, kind and kind and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we would do, and what maybe will happen to my life looking for is that the myth is true.
I want the happy to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lot in the broad mountain, and in a way, I got like a forest <unk>
It really affected me in New York ago a time ago -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you put a dollar ticket a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of these strange <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from school and <unk> and <unk> and all those things -- and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> I had Agnes Martin, I wrapped up and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking you could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it -- somehow it seemed to grow size, as if it was <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding strange electronic elements, strange bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to stand up and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow out, draw just as a body does about a dead body on the scene.
And I took the objects and created my own <unk> <unk>
First of all, you will be able to get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was very much fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures from natural size of human beings with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because it was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing in a window, then another window and another window, and it had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition came in.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a lot of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of <unk>
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
You're going to go from the <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where it <unk>
So here is where creatures are based on animals are headed for <unk> lists in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is going to be clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like the <unk> that holds the Earth and cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's an aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail of a snake tail that unites the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
It brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each of them acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's taking years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can <unk> the ticket.
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you take your penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher for these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange <unk>
There is a little forest on the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes in which we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a writer, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a company that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people inside it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that is living on.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, the borders, of religion doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things out of <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have a <unk> effect against the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective and most effective system, so that any drug medication in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs -- these are <unk> these are actually going to reduce the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects, most of the negative effects -- because in the time it takes the current to get into the stream, you get <unk> and worse in the time that you take on your destiny, which is where it's more important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the axillary <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't very easily go into the flow of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral therapy.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells out.
So this is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of a life treatment -- it's oral walking.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery -- can be used for anything else -- including <unk> transport of drugs.
In fact, we are already using a laser pulses to open or drill into extremely small holes, which open and closing almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little <unk> <unk> laser on the mobile membrane of HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drugs.
The laser passes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro <unk> or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, that is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to be the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which moves, the drug releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem very long.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
You know, what these groups are doing when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand the best to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to a confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors.
For example, from <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, they signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to be able to get <unk> or <unk> in any process of conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they <unk> how do they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and political struggle are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
Living groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent episode against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, they also have established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian who had known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just fire.
They're multitasking times.
We put a complex machinery of communication stations, radio, TV websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex hedge fund without <unk> but through business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: create stronger ties with their population, investing in social services.
They build schools for schools, run hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population, offering something that the state of security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by the war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> may also understand the efforts of these groups to deliver security up.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price of the population.
But in general, provide social services it means <unk> a vacuum gap by the government, and it enables them to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in 2006 cannot be understood without the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid here.
<unk> because they set up <unk> gaps by the government, and they emerge like armed and political groups, engaged in the violent struggle and deliver governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated organizations are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do we call a group like <unk>
It was part of the ground, you run all its functions, collect the garbage, you run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations and hybrids and the weaker the states, like in the Middle East of the Middle East today, more involved and filling that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the workforce.
You know, the government of the government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand <unk> groups, we will understand better what incentives will offer to foster the transition from violence to the violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- not <unk> the military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that security, to fill out that government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm an failure as a woman and a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid that you accept openly the label tag, it would be <unk> for <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and who had sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the <unk> who might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is for high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or <unk>
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They took the same wages for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as they are <unk> or violence.
We have the right to use that easy way and accessible the contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have these differences and how we care about the same way that matter what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths to be <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There is a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I listen to music music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and the <unk> I think, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually have your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical signal.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines, and the nice things.
And I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairies fairy tales, that they make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it is his election, and I'm not the one who is to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their children, I accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional genetics, which has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of color, the <unk> and gay workers and <unk> and <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's good, I'm a very bad feminist here.
It also happens to happen, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We hope that we would be able to push it for perfection.
When we <unk> the <unk> with a lot of <unk> from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I think about that <unk> before you try to put in there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be <unk> like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear of what that label means that he would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Take for example, for example, or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show, seeing this star of pop to embrace openly feminism and make the women and young men who being feminist is something to be proud to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless debates if it was or not a feminist.
It <unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
We actually have a tremendous amount of <unk> because we're still struggling for much, we want a lot to do -- we need so much.
We're going to go much beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> Feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or more good, increasingly, is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing an alternative supply.
These artists won't change their way to talk about women in their songs until they change change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions have to justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years old.
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
It is where they were given to the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> like something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when the movies don't deal with women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their companions like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, engaging in their project, or work with you, until you don't have a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to have to participate in this kind of projects, and we can also recognize it to be even more as well as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to get to the top, to people in the power of directors and cinema and music producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and meaningful.
We can also say with bravery our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> a bad feminist will not be at <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, about everything, because my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
Some of the guys would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated like it was nothing.
I started to believe it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
It was the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have your brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and study, I also discovered that if it was a little brave -- another woman could see me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have the absolute reality that I am just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when more people need to be able to be a courage.
Just after Christmas last year, I <unk> children in California had measles for having visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went across the border of Canada, <unk> more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the measles that it may be lousy for a child with an immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and the <unk> vaccines, and that was a marked fraud by the British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe most scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will be endangered their children from having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase in autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creating their entire professional life without seeing one single case.
Over decades, estimates of prevalence followed stable as only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if he could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Disease Center -- what is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnostic diagnosis, and a better detection detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that type of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of her son, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be asked by why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are actually having a devastating impact on global health care.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a childhood psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article which describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds, <unk> to people around their own parents.
They could have fun for hours waving their hands to their faces, but they were prey for <unk> <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy toy in their usual room without knowing it.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, which is <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the decade of 1950, as a major authority in the world was that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, let's give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
He once turned out that he had turned to nine out of 10 children sent out for other doctors in his office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of kindergarten is caused by cold, cold parents.
And these kids, he said, have been kept very carefully in a fridge they didn't understand.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they found in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 of them before the age of <unk>
When his mother put one of his favorite album, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the children were just <unk> what they had heard their parents -- desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning it into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970 that researchers started trying to test the unified theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> scientific psychologist, I thought the theory of mothers -- <unk> <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband John was warm, warm, <unk> and had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as no support, no special education, and without any access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand at the National Service Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched an prevalence of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw clearly that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse ways.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk>
In another way, these kids don't have a nice <unk> and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of the competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even an English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was translated it for her.
The document is offered an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a high school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for child teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music classes with music, and kids followed their games on <unk>
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, having been described as an described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms and <unk> spaces for the course of life.
Instead of dealing with kids in their clinic as patients, girls, he called them his little teachers, and he was engaged in the development of education methods that were especially suited to them.
And by Asperger's he saw autism as a diverse continuum that <unk> an amazing variety of patients and disability.
He believed that autism and <unk> traits were common and they've always been, looking at the aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture like the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He went beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, I worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic of the diagnostic thing that we were called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a broad and inclusive <unk>
These changes not on <unk>
<unk> when we were <unk> and Judith worked with a couple of these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult adult adult adult adult adult life.
Before I came out with <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four <unk> <unk>
At the same time, they were introduced to the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
There was no longer supposed to have a connection with that little circle of experts to make a diagnostic job.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> like they predicted <unk> and <unk> actually hoped that the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
And so Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. It's simple, <unk> and seductive history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of preventing that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are for solving for the new breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
So a way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, it doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from attention to the details.
Certainly autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most precious aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck for <unk> the ship of the <unk>
While we went into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.

You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, most read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like a farmer, or with a leather <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the picture of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When you were going to go back to her to bleed every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He did it in secret, it.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California, -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never got to know us.
You could invite Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you already found.
And I must tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see us, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it one place, the <unk> and the consider and our family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, and it was.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about it was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved the <unk>
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy that today talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I <unk> it to me around the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> a year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers in the glaciers and they break the ice.
Each iceberg has their individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up, and they hold onto the end, while others can't be <unk> more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and separated by themselves, as well as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I am breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a <unk> releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, and knowing that in these unique moments there exist in that way and will not be going to be going to be in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk>
It's very often going to get to witness a <unk> iceberg to see.
Here you have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in the average size.
<unk> about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> <unk>
So, two couples every one of a baby.
I don't want you to go too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about understanding itself, you're not going to pay attention to.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case -- the chromosome and the sperm comes up to the X chromosome of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X of the sperm joins the X chromosome up.
Both <unk> and starts life.
We'll talk about them later.
On my activity in the ground to turn two roles.
In one of my roles I work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are tracking the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluids like, the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people within a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with sex sex, individuals whose physical typology -- not fits into the male sketches and conventional female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that's not <unk> in the common <unk>
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> they become <unk>
And then, in life -- the testicles make testosterone.
But because this guy has no story <unk> the body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So there are high levels of testosterone but without response.
As a result, the body develops in a course typically <unk>
When you <unk> the baby is a little girl.
It's a little boy, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when somebody realizes something is happening.
And after doing tests realize that instead of having ovaries and <unk> it actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's about a man, but it really isn't.
Women, like men, like men, we have a little bit called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The <unk> glands produce the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, and I think it's a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life like a boy and had just found out that he was <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had chromosomes and in the uterus the <unk> glands, they were so active that they essentially created a male voice?
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormonal component typically male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age 19, when it started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was women inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that is, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how it happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- when they are <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
And the reason that they <unk> to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings into a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- it will be black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when we have a body that shows us something fairly different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic <unk> concept.
So imagine the amazing thing that is having children who are born like two people in a body.
The most big case is last year in the past year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the Olympic <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine if you're <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that nature is so complicated that nature doesn't trace a line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> we are us who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, more we need to admit that these categories -- which we thought were <unk> categories that were <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- they are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology is <unk>
So as we see, we get into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we <unk> from the fact that they were in just a few <unk>
And as we thrive in science we get increasingly in a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that <unk> categories.
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors had never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of the pen you put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved around, I still didn't get it.
If you stopped moving it out.
But today, we can, for example, extract life organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma to actually determine the death of someone. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, to the people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that she gets a nervous, he gets a nervous.
You know that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about.
<unk> from the point of view of a democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find every bit looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explained why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we did -- our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The two of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right birth.
They had the concept of blue blue.
They were the idea that the political power was coming into the political power of the <unk> of the father of the father and father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea, and they replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game camp and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the differences -- that was something very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the history of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power to be passed by a vague idea of the right birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence -- they talk about nature, and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence they were broadcasting the idea of <unk>
And when they do that, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of Human Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
What happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people from color people that are <unk> at <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start to ask why we keep certain <unk>
But now, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish to the same rights than a human.
I don't want to say that we had to stand before anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years they had to allow them to have sex and get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: I was at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time -- June 1, 1980.
Henry, by the contrary, was born in term, was born on March March in 1980.
By the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the three months before Henry -- the right -- right -- right, right, the right to vote, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Well, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be a man now is <unk> from the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, in the hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So still <unk> categories, that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now is that science advanced both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas has ever decided to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome, and that to marry a woman you have to have the <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests for the people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you to the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I would have a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems so good."
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we had to focus on this for human rights to people, because I will admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some human I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of the contents of the <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me asks what if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current current thinking to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we will make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless you are willing to have a change of sex, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made a few years ago that I had made birth twins and then pick them up, and so he <unk> her name.
But when the phone was asked by the <unk> he was a very <unk> operation, he told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to.
I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum instead of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are without <unk> to change the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean, I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater involvement in <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit about a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way we think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and engage in those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my <unk> I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered a feminist, as a <unk> made me <unk>
<unk> what does it have the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I have to think about your question, most of me has seemed to be a little female in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different among the brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if we were <unk> they were really aware of finding the way to protect the people by the state, is it possible to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we make democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily afford the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just went through the buildings on the apartments.
So imagine that half the one who wanted to live in apartment -- they were owners and that the other half is still not to do that.
They could try to increase the ability by doing <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and create the building of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to an entirely new place, build a completely new apartment building and when the rules of that place will be given to the construction instead of putting them up.
So I proposed that governments to develop new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> went through a constitutional crisis in the summer of it.
In the next few presidential election, <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a platform that promised reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that tell you that you can't go and digitize all the current residents in apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies like <unk> and usually they're the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost.
And he used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, is worth thousands per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, it said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> Talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> came to me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which I was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and we have to start with a site that is to measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 <unk>
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this <unk> explained that a new city can make new choices for people.
There would be an option in a city that could go to that could be <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away into the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would require help from countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all be confident that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw the site.
This photo is there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And little later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution, and to add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special fields.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional cause was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17 was ever approved in another voting <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting voting at 24 of February, a <unk> shifting shifting <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in Korea -- it's bigger than the Boston center.
All you see there was built in four years after four years later getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this as practical as, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and the time would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the court of ultimately for this new justice system.
There are <unk> and community builders, which are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to go on in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to go back to their family to go to get a job, sometimes they are unwed mothers who have to gain money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to think about insist for the families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find a film and more recently, photograph and post in my blog and colorful <unk> for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is <unk> and my whole <unk> hand <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are passionate about, usually my money is going to a good <unk> -- my look at it is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
I will like color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive -- then I feel like I've won.
So to go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to do, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pair of underwear, and nothing else.
So inside that just a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after you get to Palm <unk>
And they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED <unk>  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with a Sunday.
I call this tiger bright.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the <unk> including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and simultaneously <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you will also get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play the <unk> or I remind you for your little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't see you right with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and external person -- you don't see you can't afford it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth, six words for you, the gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people were approaching this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave some things.
I don't need to emotionally emotionally to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart, and I came up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where is your brain at this scale?
Some of these <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this, with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that another <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as much as most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
So how do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them, and then we see it as react. And then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed over the time is the one that says that one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking bar.
It was a little kid and he didn't do it very well, he always <unk>
But I bet that I play with that bar on the parking parking lot taught him a very precious lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all of these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, the physics was a few years ago, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That is not very good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But they don't have good at my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the tiny particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should not all follow the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why it didn't.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. Is it right at the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal <unk> with a springboard and which is <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would give a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming bottle that is found underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator -- I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people go up and do those things, because I don't want to bother you, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that you know, and the wind that happens to their side, and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to think about quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We looked at the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then they would give it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that he moved in very strange ways.
Instead of being perfectly still, it was vibrating. and the way he <unk> was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that didn't make them at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion of atoms that make up that metal piece are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time you're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
But it was <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because watch this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that piece of metal is kind of the same thing that the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you as well?
I mean, it's my part that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, what would that be?
How are you acting your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, and we saw the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator actually only are all quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that <unk>
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that are around you, they literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that he was here and she allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
And a lot of negotiations and stories, they were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go museums, started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than I can show the demo, and then I'm going to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have taken away from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There is the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You are moving around and <unk>
You want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jump inside.
You're inside, you want to go at the end of the hallway,
Keep forward. That <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 billion bars.
And there are many people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10 billion <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really can do with 10 billion pixel up.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, <unk> this seems <unk>
I came in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing to something.
I had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into depth and see that you really can get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you really see what it is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going quickly to jump over at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this piece of play.
It increases and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk>
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things over here, but I don't have time <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same thing.
You can online to create your own museum, to create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we go -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just got a zooming around.
This is <unk> <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things out, you send your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I believe that for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even come from the museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital midst does justice to their artwork and that is represented very closely online.
And the great question that I do today is you have to do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a flying pixel here.
In our lab we call it responsive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, <unk> all kids in Italy who are growing up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting about <unk> careers -- one in the last two decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> 1, and I took a budget and you give it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what it is in engineering, and this is an engineering system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What is interesting is that today's control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're turning computers into the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of <unk> consumption -- and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are coming into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the late <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
It's kind of like almost all the atoms that are going to become <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing. the interaction that we have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that he was the <unk> and he threw it back into Moses -- you know, you can still see a little bit of a <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> What didn't <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and driving something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago, in Italy.
It was a summer, hopefully about 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember it, they were actually -- Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, he won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day that day looking at <unk> activity in the net.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the afternoon, there are people here and there are people standing here doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You see, people do a quick call.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, <unk>
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
You see the great peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the team and the prime minister then.
And then everyone down.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> <unk> people go to <unk> is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how we can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, but of things we use and consume them.
Today, we know everything about the side of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are going.
So in this project, we developed some small labels to track the trash in their shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, and a <unk> <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't have before.
They're going on complicated things, and there is a lot of lack transport.
But the other thing we think is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> is not still anywhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still follows there.
If we showed that to people, then we can promote some change in behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about, the very beginning, which is the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe has a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels fall down the pixels in them, you can write patterns, images, <unk>
And by the <unk> the curtain will open up so that we could happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
I liked it a lot.
And we <unk> a commission to design the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows or windows, but when you come up to it is open to you that you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> your roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, go out the roof, and he said, "Let's get the <unk>
No, it's not that you have <unk> but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see the <unk> people what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was opening for letting me pass, but a building that kept doing <unk> and holes, and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as the architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people give to our designs.
But then the reality is always <unk>
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use it.
This is a picture of the building with the 1990s, the pixels of water, and the projections of the projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
So imagine that those pixels are able to start flying.
So imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel -- that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with other <unk>
Could we form this cloud, right?
This is a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration, in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, in which what it changes is light, not the position of the pixel
You can play with a different guy.
So imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D which you can get anywhere near and look at it from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancing dancers today, the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
It's both <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go through the entire way.
And once we have the pixels to play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of them make a little bit of a <unk>
And I think what has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world in the digital world.
We have <unk> everything like knowledge, and it's accessible across the Internet.
Now for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world to the <unk> power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it may be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do you go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel up.
It's a physical structure in London.
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get into it there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for more precise, faster and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, it will be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else do you tell you about <unk>
What do they want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many do you want the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED Conference but I want to give you a little doctor on the subject.
The great 20th century of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the Canadian Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense except for the <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Does it mean the other or <unk>
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is of course, the most interested people.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years old.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
They realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is <unk> which is that it comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all have in the intestine more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> is asked by the <unk> think of <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that they can want to want without their part.
It's really like a fast way for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of any rush into the way.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients out and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we get the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms every cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two other daughters cells.
But when organisms show up, the things start to change.
It goes into a scene in sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with every year that was happening, but every year was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their 90 years.
And one night someone <unk> his hotel door.
He opens the door.
And in front of him you find a very small dancer.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It's OK -- says George, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to be healthy.
I wanted to get health into the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about moving the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are as <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us let us fall into the sea.
I think all of us <unk> the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
Not necessarily favors the bigger or the stronger or the faster or even the most clever.
Evolution favors the better adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria, which can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would see if there were fish there, fish, dry <unk> but yet they've managed to make a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look back at the end of the <unk> stage, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that they don't know.
We've had a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and disappear from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for ourselves as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we have so much that no longer possible to have the isolation, we need to make evolution happen.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of traditional type, natural type, the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when you sort of <unk> distant planets going to exist in isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, and a very intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the choices that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So let's first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to be <unk>
Think about it as well as possible could be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future, that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year after being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost to a cost to the cost 20,000 and a week.
It's not a lot to be a lot to make the human genome -- and be more and more at the grasp of all.
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but they are going to <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course the course of the flu vaccine.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality, and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
So imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, which is reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to have a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why not have a <unk> <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions that are going to happen to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to make the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally lead to 100,000 years and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or their grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options on a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more and more robust or more robust or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound of all: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For a good or for worse, and before what I could do is, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great bang when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. It was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk about with the flight <unk>
So they immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had taken off the airplane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the road.
They took the engines.
Imagine being in an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words that ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. It was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to appreciate all the experiences I have wanted to have and never implemented.
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to know anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about it, I really feel like a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, I have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I think it didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my wife, with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And after, I decided to do that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I am no longer trying to have reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die is not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a kind of thought, which is, I just wish a thing.
I wish I could see my children grow up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  -- and I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point, I really understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was <unk> a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please not be -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What do you think they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the most great thing when I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that graffiti is <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> saw Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and you have a very good <unk> you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate <unk>
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, and they go <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented me with the single desire to deliver a check and instead signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
My brother <unk> with his brother and his father there at the time, "All right, this is <unk> Tony goes to talking, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inner can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then a laser laser, draw about that and record negative space.
So you go through art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They first start with the sex organs, then with the bad words -- then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies, and we get a machine so that they could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "You don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the <unk> world from all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were going, they would have taken the squares of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks later, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of it, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a pair of cheap sun that we buy in the <unk> <unk> and some copper wire and things from Home <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it up on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- we published the code -- we published the <unk> code, the software goes down into free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says <unk>
There's no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of planning, professional sessions -- all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so I could see it.
And we put a projector on a wall on the outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot and so we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time that he was <unk> in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would get me out of there so I could get it out.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our war.
That's what keeps us in movement, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized it as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that on April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in Los Angeles center there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it happen.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible.
Do you know anything about this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology I just recognized something and I would tell me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel that we need to do. If it's not me, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years of <unk> in the very difficult situations and at the same time a very dangerous time.
I went to the difficult <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
I show you in difficult and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days -- it was just fun -- a lot of fun in the middle, very dangerous in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to examine social questions in ways that <unk> <unk> interesting, and, hopefully analyzing a way that was <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the next thing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk -- that you have no idea what it is about and as the contents could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said that, it's a very good opportunity to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have been able to tell you for certainty.
But in the new film I am working on, we looked at the world of marketing, the <unk>
And as I said earlier, I have gotten into some horrifying situations in the last few years, but nothing could tell me -- nothing could be done for something that hard or as dangerous as we go into the living rooms.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to deal with products, and marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with products, marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to be called "The greatest <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything up to the bottom, in the beginning of the end, has images of brand, and it has all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just <unk>
It was <unk> It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the X-ray sponsor in the title but we're going to make sure we put all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe you have a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe that you have <unk>
The most great thing that you have to lead to the greatest film ever <unk> the best drink, you have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as a part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the complete idea -- all the shot -- from beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- is the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> But I don't know how it was going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Don't <unk> How much money does it do to do this?
MS: One and a half and a half -- <unk> <unk> very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meet with them, but that certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we look at it as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
And Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or being I?
JK:
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need help. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Okay, good. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to go on.
MK: We have some places where I would go to <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: So I thought it was <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of it.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None had anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as much people as possible, to make that so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the separate media scenario is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that comes up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last big line.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians the <unk> the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to it actually something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency day --  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare <unk> path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
You put an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want me to tell them <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but you know, <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a child, and my father would tell me in some lie -- -- and there he looked at me, and he said, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, and it's my story, and there's history <unk>
You see, in this film -- we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency would want to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my account, I would have to take off the mediate and go to the business I myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out -- which I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big, huge enormous movies, and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make very high Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The greatest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little bit nervous.
I want to help you that <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much to be a man like a solid, solid, to <unk> to <unk> like that.
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at a <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a little <unk>
You know, the kind of smaller movies that we have, we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people to be the reason why this is in us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something interesting <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category on positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
You keep it cool.
How do we keep you fresh more time? With better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my firm.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: revive the 1980s -- <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: Okay, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Something unique <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
They're usually wearing accessories like <unk> or I like the crystals and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, would call him <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: It's partly hippie partly partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the kind of pets.
Let's make toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I suppose that's my firm.
In my little sector, that's my firm.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: He had failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be a Tom, but I often took me back at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a family photo.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> from that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you go around -- like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come home and start in a place and in my case start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What is the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like, who would like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things. I like the weird stuff.
A: <unk> of the <unk> for what does it mean?
What's the <unk> What phase is <unk>
Why is it important? What is <unk>
It was a little bit about that.
<unk> more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> you have <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of Russian coaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Great A: Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.)
MS: Yeah, I don't know what it's going to come out of this.
There was so crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality personality -- the Morgan <unk> brand is a <unk> brand.
They got very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's the nature of the <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements and you actually give them a bit positive for you, and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other marks are this?
The first here is the <unk> <unk>
And you can see here by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your identity, your brand, your personality <unk> what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're someone who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk> <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary -- like, bold or bold like <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more of <unk> <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred, or wise or wise like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film, how they now use MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain so much for a movie for films.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the open.
Throughout the city for the last five years there is no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting to the way in schools with problems with money problems in the United States.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects in which I have had the most success or the ones that I've ever had more success are those ones I've ever experienced with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They had it success?
Well, since the movie was sent into the <unk> <unk> <unk>
According to <unk> the film was sent out in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a <unk> period.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film was still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not on <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun.
And it's not bad, because most of the agencies that we talk about is <unk> their clients not to be part.
I have always believed that if you take a <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks there is opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them into failure.
I believe that when you train your employees in the <unk> to the risk of the <unk> to make the rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people that are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give the fear of fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of fear -- the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately we have to stand on the transparency.
Now more than never a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> they bought the rights.
<unk> <unk> great data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, I think, in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED matrix, the Foundation, the <unk> Foundation, to be applied to my healthcare care next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest <unk> to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus from Windows into a portable computer that was used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, gray, <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started searching about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> boxes.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they went very strange stuff.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab in the lab that didn't like our <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experiencing different taste of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at the <unk> in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working at that place.
If not, they don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we knew the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack code, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two bombs and a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were <unk> very professionally for people who obviously had the inner information.
Let's get all the points for those to attack.
You probably even know how much it was <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've ever seen before.
Here you see a sample of this <unk>
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty old <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking at the first was called calls in the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> structures and tried to match it with the real world, with potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to the theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely an violent <unk> must be a white <unk> and it's probably sitting in Iran because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>
You don't find a lot of thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear nuclear power plant, and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went into an effort by <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of <unk>
And rotor is that mobile part within the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
And what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and it was going to make it slow down in an effort to make it nuts to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> is <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And they got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
So it wasn't like it like this.
The results have been from several weeks of hard work.
You know, we were <unk> in dead dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would say to one and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not be afraid of other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top box you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of the sensors for example, for the pressure sensors and the audio sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still <unk> which is still going on during the attack, with fake data.
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds in video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the fourth control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam steam goes down, you have to open exhaust.
Obviously, this can't do this a human operator.
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this load with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you did that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are <unk>
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we start to prepare right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, they really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There's one alone and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that will be able to take away and give them <unk> skills, or another one that makes users of wheelchair raise and raise them to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that is put in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is also going to increase your speed, and aid, for example, for example, how to manage balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and other things that are <unk>
This is not an idea.
To show you now at what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage of it.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Human commandments.
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can give you 90 pounds of variables for many hours.
His flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run a big <unk>
So what I want to do, or where do I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk>
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back now and look at the users of wheels, what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on the wheels, in the whole world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people with damage to the spinal cord than when their life is -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- bumping into a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that happens to be divided quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago -- he had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result, he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send the computer on board, here on the back.
There is also a battery of batteries that give the motors to the motors in the trouble, and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all the <unk> movement down.
Shortly after a doctor later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You know, you'll never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole me to the last few moments of hope to be.
The technology of adapting to me has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down on <unk> climbing rocks and even riding rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not only of soldiers, but to India and all the people on the wheels, everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just went back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day, where the fun is really serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in the rainforests of the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives more <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where violence is still not yet before.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to do.
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has taken for decades, and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat trade, and deforestation is not able to fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughing laugh at the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes -- they have love, the love, not the <unk> because they have passive sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity given that the lives of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play all their life.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of diversity -- diversity -- diversity of connections.
And when you look at the <unk> <unk> you see the roots <unk> of the laughter, the dance and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> style, and I'm not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves it, right?
Yes.
So the sexual game is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing elements to the game -- like the game -- and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with the water <unk>
I believe that, as she said, sometimes we played themselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the realization that Bonobos Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world increasingly difficult and more difficult and most cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> of adaptation.
In order to adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's give you the most of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate for play, it can be the moments in which it is most <unk>
So by that, fellow primates, we will accept this gift of evolution and let's try and play together while creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a Captain <unk> in a volunteer body.
And in our city, where volunteers will be engaged in a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race for the other volunteers to get the captain to the captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly passed away one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, and she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked her to go back and would save the dog from the owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building to save a live alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need that I need to go home.
I need you to be able to speak to you, the fire, and I bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise that.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the firemen -- that at that height or less had been finished to turn out the fire and went to the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my <unk> on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for the house of the house where, as it was expected, their treasure. got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house <unk> by the brave effort to save their house.
The kindness that she watched on the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling as a volunteer -- I'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also in a <unk> scale, but also in the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have achieved, or are there for <unk> very remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you, no wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a little bit about giving, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood.
Be mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules from a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
This is called a <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion bricks or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or house.
It made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little bit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> aesthetic piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows us to create much bigger and more complex circuits a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think about it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they're aggregate through magnets.
So you can't be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
<unk> have a code of color.
The green is the <unk> blue is the stream, the pink input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just put together a blue blue with green one, and you can really quickly start making higher circuits.
A blue blue blue one is making light.
We can put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We had this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to connect and connect and <unk> <unk> allow us to program using very simple gestures, using a very simple basis?
To do <unk> faster or slower -- just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a remote collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to get into bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels -- everything needs to be accessible.
We have given <unk> to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of all the days that don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light light work, or why is the door to an elevator <unk> or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, the designers without some experience in electronic electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  So a few weeks ago, we have <unk> the design of Rhode Island designers that don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> Canyon, moving motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is really afraid of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the grasp of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved in the environment to focus on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait, wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue better we leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I was going to be time at time?
Okay. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to represent the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They worked with great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
His task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
I know <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it shows you as if I would look for a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody got to clean up when you get caught in the snow because you know it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did they get to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else -- that the citizens <unk> with shovels -- just in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can have a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put it a name, in this case, he put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a mechanical component of it.
It's a modest app.
Maybe the smallest of the 21 applications of <unk> last year.
But does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads into viral ways.
One responsible for systems in the city of <unk> to see this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for the citizens to be able to do <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk>
So for the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just launch it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that use using it.
And this has been spread <unk> in an organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that it doesn't normally happen.
The software acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and over two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that all the time has taken over 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that shows you in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot by the institution of the government.
It suggests to the government better ways to work, not like in private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to tackle the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to make them together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They've not given up with the government.
They feel a lot of frustration that they feel but not <unk> it <unk>
And these people know something we have lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone didn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And given that the government ultimately made it out of -- you remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way of producing the change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people in order to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the heart of service and information.
It's the place that the calls the calls if you mark it in the United States.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> on the base of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of your house, put it very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no call center.
It has an app and cell phones called <unk> <unk>
They didn't make that app.
It was the work of very clever people in the Bureau of New York City <unk> <unk>
One day, this actually comes this <unk> <unk> in my bucket <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I gave the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to a distributed partner.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I'm not necessarily talking about the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it might have connected to the government services that you need to be needed but the neighbor is a better alternative, and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, they <unk> their communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do that, but you think you're the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will change our values and we need our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow layer of <unk>
So below this is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is <unk> what keeps it that belongs to us that we funded as something that operates on our against something else, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy feel sexy.
Because that's where the real work happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed <unk> report in response to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have faced with government, it's time that we ask ourselves, what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that the technology is that technology is possible to rethink the root function of government that can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years and I, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who are going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express their views in any channel at the same time.
So when we face the government problem don't really care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring their hands to the work to program applications that do work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> by taking a <unk> dumping a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we always could have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they don't make the citizen <unk>
So I want to ask all of us, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we will also have a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities in the projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And to be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is important.
Here we've seen fantastic ones.
And I think we have learned that the words of a professor can have a lot of sense, but if they are taught with feeling, they can have a special difference.
A doctor can do good things, but if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the right, my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional home of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard so strong, it was power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia and <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way it looked at the world.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was a little and looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel like my <unk>
And if I said no, I would tell me again and if I was telling him that yes, I stopped me in peace.
I had this human quality that made you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning, I thought it was a game.
So he looked at her, and he looked at her, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went into the room, and he took me out of the hand, and he said, "Come on, <unk> The two will <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
It took me outside and said, "You know, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I guess I didn't know -- I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can make you <unk>
I will never forget it.
And then he said, "Just do I want you to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell you, is that you will always do the right thing if the right thing is to be <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell you, is that you never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Idaho, I have a brother a year and a sister a small year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I didn't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and I went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well. Take a <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And he came up with the strength and <unk> "Oh, it's not going to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I'm about 52 years old, and I can tell you that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this as a <unk> I'm saying it by the power that it has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really see any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, it finds so <unk> so much despair.
One of the three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, <unk> Baltimore -- Washington, 50 to 60 to 60 percent of the young color in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is something that affects the results of the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some developments well curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you care about rights, by always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to a vote.
And if we put it in the next 10 years the level of the loss of being as high as it was before they <unk> the law law to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world where he sentence to children from 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without any possibility to go out.
Now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This matter of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crime crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified an innocent one that is innocent and released from the death row.
One rate of error, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation you wouldn't have ever allowed to fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in history <unk> I talk about <unk>
I talk to you about terrorism, the age that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are more people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time is going to happen to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome race segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany speaking about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's very disturbing to listen to what you're going to do.
<unk> "Not <unk> in Germany.
We can never be here."
The room stayed quietly and a lady said, "There is no way with our history, we can ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we were going to be <unk>
It was going to happen on this.
How do we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, we would have to get people, especially if they were in their majority of <unk>
We wouldn't have it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by the technology. We love creativity.
We love entertainment.
But recently, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, <unk> ones that never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to intellectual care.
And with innovation, with creativity, development is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from ideas -- they also have the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was to hope, guidance for spirit, an will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women came together to just talk to them.
Occasionally, I call it to me -- to say, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> We're going to get up to talk to you.
You want to come and get it out.
I said, "Yes, lady. Be <unk>
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went led to me and said, "Now, please tell me that this idea of <unk> justice.
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started to give you my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk> <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end the life sentences for life, without freedom hanging for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and I looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you know, <unk> exhausted, very <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I believe that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way we address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in stuff.
I have come to understand and believe that each of us is higher than the worst thing we have ever seen.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves by our technology, by our designs, not by our intellectual intellectual capacity.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
The judge is <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
And one night I was very late at my wake up <unk> For God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you have to have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer <unk> a small <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer was treated as a higher privileged person, executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there have been <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, I didn't just have it, but I had sent to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, my God, I have to go to the court for this case stupid.
I got on the car, and I was really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down from the car. I walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When I saw me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I approached me and <unk>
And I would focus on the ear, you know.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute into the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know "Mr. <unk> And we started flying.
People started getting to. They were all <unk>
I was the ones that had written those <unk>
They came in, the prosecutors the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And suddenly I didn't know how the room was full of people, so we are talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I started to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window, and you wanted to hear all that <unk>
Come on, walking over here and so on.
Finally, this old black <unk> with a concern, he went into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black <unk>
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black man stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> audience to tell this young man who keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come today to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds up toward justice.
That we can't be truly human, if we don't care about human rights, and for the dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
What is our technology, design, entertainment and creativity must <unk> the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the vision for the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, in this community, to help you do something.
One is a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities at all.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to make a effort to give them the funds that they spend today in management policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row over the next five years. billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases, not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> these funds to make the law for safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decrease in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you that you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric for punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply chain, to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
I think our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: You know, you have been excited about it today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be over the last six days or in the last six years.
The idea is that American media would mean <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And like nothing matters more to survive, the first stop to all of this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and the whole information is looking for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So from a <unk> of stories -- to look at the negative.
That old saying, "If there are blood, you know, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, is not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe it won't.
Maybe, what really happens is that we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues of climate change, the <unk> species, the scarcity of water and <unk> we have no doubts them.
As human beings are very good at solving the problems, and in the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average per capita income, adjusted for inflation in the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy passed from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living in an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we still have <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water, filtered -- mobile television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and, recently, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put into information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law -- and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that's -- in good and bad times, in the war and the peace, in recession, in depression and on the rise.
It's the result of quick computers that used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law -- there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, which my friends are called infinite computing, sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, and fuel biology, the fuel and the <unk>
I mean, how many people saw the victory of "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I tried to <unk> the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
So imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or a service that can affect the impact of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would have been <unk>
We can point out there today to point out a bunch of companies that have done it.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> in the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
This is about taking that it's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the <unk> King of <unk>
The <unk> troops ate with covered in silver, and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, which was more than gold and <unk>
So the tip of the Washington in Washington is of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure <unk>
It's bound by oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
So let's take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a <unk> planet, for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk>
It's not about fatal and <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, the electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have plenty of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed down the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after it passed away.
It took a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is fresh water, two percent is ice, and we fight for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes <unk> the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen -- this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small fridge big.
It is capable of generating a thousand liters of water safe to the day of any source -- saltwater, water water, for less than two cents the gallon.
The Coca-Cola president just found that it will make a major test test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that goes out right, and I have confidence in which it will be, Coca-Cola is able to implement it in <unk> <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an enormous innovation of this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get 70 percent of the mobile penetration in the developing world for 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And with a smart phone, with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video libraries and music, technology, diagnostic technology, now <unk> and lost market value with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing to get to when the stock is in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device with the ones that speak, and because they have <unk> they can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
So imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA virus that we don't want to call the healthcare, and first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a <unk> world.
I call it the <unk> million increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just passed the brand of the 7 billion <unk>
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users on the Internet.
Three billion minds ever before they add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What would you like to do it?
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Academy and because of the use of 3D calculation, and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three million more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the underdog wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and we can act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 mean?
And if they're contributions we can't afford to.
One thing I learned with the X X is that teams, guided by their passion with a clear goal -- they can do things -- things that were previously able to make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folding determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the pattern recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power today to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds from new minds that we have to work on to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we need to do.
We have a few decades of extraordinary.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe it was <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
We caught it much until the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have any special of it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets are still saying they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some mangroves.
There were <unk> of about 20 centimeter the black <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made over the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five inches.
It makes a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
That is nothing to be changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishery in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- I mean, it started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing fishing was to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad.
I went out to fish in it, and we have studies in the south of the China Sea <unk> and especially in the <unk> Sea.
What we found there, was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny blobs about <unk> remains that they're coral reef fish.
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary, because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
He was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's no <unk>
We don't remember it.
Let's get the point to start to start to start to start to start what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation is using the images that the beginning of their conscious life as normal and they extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk> of change.
And at the end of the end, I keep a <unk> remains.
And that's largely we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they are no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when traditional societies, kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose animal animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a dark sea of large fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain and such a lot of fish in this area could not be used -- and usually they don't use it the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that you can fulfill a protected zone.
Because with the marine protected zones, we really recreated the past.
You know, the past that people can't think of because the starting point has run and extremely low.
That's for people that you can see a marine marine area and can benefit from the vision that you need, which enables you to erase your point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the west, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the <unk> bay 500 years ago.
And you might have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why they <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in some sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to <unk> to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see today why this videos are made viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today the web video makes any of us, or of our <unk> actions, in a part of our global culture.
You can get a famous thing on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video on YouTube per minute.
And of these, only a little percentage goes viral is getting a infinite number of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of participation communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this film shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of the mass of last summer.
<unk> didn't want to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you're called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were a lot of videos from nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this statement that he <unk> the video to the popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> show us things and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, on Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants to get on the weekend, the weekend.                                              
<unk> from Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos in the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows you how often we use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, he took it <unk> and so many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends will embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then start talking about it and do things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an orange animation, with a <unk> music.
That's the whole thing.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke up between the Internet community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an old version.
And then it became international it.
Suddenly, a whole community came up with a sense of it that made this happen to be a joke that's dumb to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written by <unk> this situation?
In a world where two video days go up two days for minute, just the truly unexpected thing and unexpected can make it up.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that <unk> against <unk> in New York, I admit, I wasn't very interested in much.

KA: Thank you to the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> I knew five million you saw and understand your idea.
So this approach is worth all new that we do creative form.
And all this leads us to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of clinical communities, creative communities are totally unexpected, they are characteristics of a new media, of a new culture, which we all have access and the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't use permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, just like the current media today, but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
So imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supportive of the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> enter the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so much time, friends, I would now have it <unk>
It was <unk> in the silence.
He died in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My task was not to let it have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task for his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> four years that defies fiction, a boat is slid into the sea sea as a regular ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we first came out, we would first take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are out of that boat, the constant pace of the engine, <unk> diving in every single <unk> and vast horizon and vacuum.
I don't remember pirates that came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of the men in our boat, or the engine dying and couldn't be able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and killed, finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I tried to have for the men on the pad.
No apple had the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, they <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> classes, whose population is comprised of prostitution.
Unlike the middle class <unk> whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the clips of English <unk> <unk> among the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working on a <unk> <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and math, wouldn't you mind what should be, who was usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle school, one to hide holes from the other.
A high school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to make it happen.
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> guys trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> classical student with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other one, it was <unk> in everyday lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them were given help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of teacher, they chose the young Australian <unk>
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident now was now <unk> <unk> and social activist invited me to speak in places that I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the routines. And the comfort of life in a foreign suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and a <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do that.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got on the ship.
The "no" had ever been an option.
<unk> said to me, <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking, more was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they would do, living on the border of as possible.
And although I ended up my hometown I realized I couldn't stand in a career of law.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's well going to be a stranger, a newly new and not just that it's good, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a shooting gift.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mixture of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
I went to a small group of people who the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, it was a giant <unk> pot that all <unk>
<unk> until well at the night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some very bright and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who matters.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without his husband, he caused a <unk> to <unk> and bringing the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't have proven to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the <unk> hotel in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk>
And I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw the stand on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to get his hands up.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"They have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would be very easily.
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that to do that.
However, I fear the privilege of the right right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your life, a brave <unk> the <unk> pace of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if you could give it and see them safe, it would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here today in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old former Indian <unk> <unk> <unk>
In those days when the Indians want to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with <unk>
At that time when you <unk> the great Prince Indian warrior <unk> he had <unk> he pulled a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me very much.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I was telling me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to allow me to do.
As a girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this kind of technology technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images and pirates <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile clocks, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it from <unk>
We love our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I threw up to this technological world to see how to use it to make magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we took the book off.
Where we are.
They put the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do for that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  says, "This box belongs -- I write my name.
And so I get back a character from the book.
And at several moments I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live, because of GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl is excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar are always turned out to me.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to liberate fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what your book.
Another idea that fascinated me with a little girl was that a whole galaxy, in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag toward this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all kinds of fantasy I've always have maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guides you for the rest of the book.
In certain parts of the book it was <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts -- the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we are bringing them back into a children's history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out outside the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to retrieve this ritual in childhood you have to go out and in a chapter, and you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a photo of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the connection of connection between magic, Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction in which you get out with the iPad and the video on and through <unk> you see a <unk> group that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are attached to technology and magic and technology come up to each other.
It turns out the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and romantic love that we sat down through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to an listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, this is one of the greatest problems for what all of us, or maybe not everybody, but most of the projects of <unk> fail to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> on and <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when I needs healthcare, or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity activity to have more control of their health.
It was going to be available from next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And the people <unk> from their homes, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share with them, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, and they go back to control, and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us healthcare because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of the health care costs, the <unk> of the demand and other issues.
We make techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with you with a video with you.
We all have checks in the <unk>
Maybe we even have it on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs are in <unk>
What are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
So what we did was make <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please look at where, and when it's open, you know, when it's open, you sometimes open up in the office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality.
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to focus on the global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work like a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on holiday and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And also I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be messaging services, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows you is still in your place.
Please look at this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was awakened to my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
He mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was on the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when you <unk> the <unk>
For me the photograph I had more to see in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very tight road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as photography.
So what you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
Would you make light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic it's realistic but what we think is a realist.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you an easy example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it combined in a certain way can create something that still seems <unk> as if I existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go into the brain because the brain doesn't assume the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually in combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic as realistic as a matter of those in which we don't even recognize the things around us in our daily lives.
But in combining photographs, it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something is wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are combined to have the same kind of light.
And these two images have these <unk> they have taken the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is <unk>
But this picture is completely comprised of photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put the ideas on the ideas that have in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The coast is a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made the red <unk> the top of the island, so it seems more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome I think we lack planning for.
It always starts with an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result may be very beautiful, and maybe a realist.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a little bit about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder -- mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details, but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this is like many other that we tend to see, is sort of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
I'm talking about technology with <unk> curves that is a novel thing.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
You get more intensity because you write about paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves on <unk>
The answer is that if I draw them on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to take away the diagram that would look like something ludicrous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you were to say, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly. We would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a change <unk>
If the technology of transport technology is as fast as the <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of the technological development history that every few years to advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- to look at these <unk> curves -- we see that they don't still forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is: What is that new way that <unk> the world?
So when new state is <unk>
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
That happens to happen.
And we know that it doesn't have much sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that you can be <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at the long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do that is time for life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back about two billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that would spread around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals were organized -- we give us a sense of how things happen.
And I think there is theories to start to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, I had taken some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes on the inside.
Some of those oil oil drops were a particular combination of chemicals that made them put into the outside of the outside and so drops them grew up grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most mundane forms of cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them had a random random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it was <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So each <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time to bring the <unk> <unk> <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple chemistry, but things get interesting -- interesting when these drops the trick of the <unk>
In some ways that we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without meaning, a <unk> writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that <unk> system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> white dust that I try to hide to the security people.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and we would take it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants to have a hundred million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it in a virus and would have spread it into the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells that were happy to be <unk> million years old.
But then another great step happened in which things were <unk> very different and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we have evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are lots of resilient at penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or that if a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities were very close to that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community on a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities -- communities of many different cells working together like a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have lots of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not good without the heart of the heart, or the muscles or the brain, or so on.
So these communities evolved and produced the more interesting levels that cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures to understand and to transmit the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because they knew bad and sick and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now be confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea.
I'm here sitting emitting some <unk> and, hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in his heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we became sound, on sound sequences and make something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now went through periods of the <unk> organisms -- our funding methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of the language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you was taken a billion years out of each one.
The next few days, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
<unk> the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And again, as electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that does its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without the recent <unk>
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make it <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction -- we put it on the machine, and we put it on the machine, and it does something that has done before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using recently is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sets of instructions to chance?
You could run these <unk> instructions at random, running all of those programs, and to take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more of us to look at numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could figure out two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we have the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analogous to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the children will have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of computer programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's try it again.
So let's put some mutations in.
And he tries again and try and move it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or really complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that were <unk> numbers absolutely perfect.
In fact, it's much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to be trying to look at how they work.
They're <unk> <unk>
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of shows that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once I was in a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and it takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight -- doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become messy.
So we started to rely on computers to make a different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that we are.
In that sense, it is in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs very quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent long enough to allow me to afford to give up a part of my false status on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, we talk about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, it's coming up to the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's for <unk> <unk> <unk> talking about statistics and <unk> to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope a lot of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that we had 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game in the game without being <unk> and anyone who tries to throw it at the first base, not to get to time, and the second basis to be <unk>
three attempts of 10.
You know what they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the Black League player in run more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> in a surgeon who has also a record for 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place of place, and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor is driven by a cardiologist whose record <unk> is <unk>
But you know anything?
She's really improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you the question:
What do you think it must be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I was included in the world of being perfect.
What ever, ever would ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it good.
That was the message that I was talking about when I was in medical school.
I was a totalitarian <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied for a blood test.
Same which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the General <unk> Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything of memory.
My kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent differential diagnosis and <unk>
And even knew the partial diagnostic about how they classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were to <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or as you can, close to everything -- because I get rid of the errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when brought to the emergency lady in the emergency service where I worked out.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when he was applied to a cardiologist I was going to go to this patient.
And to report to the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound in both sides, what was sent to me with heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, they fill with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I <unk>
He gave aspirin and medication to ease the pressure on their heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I really made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't pick up the phone and I did what I should have done, which I was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to do <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
He sent her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my mind that said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse who was taking care of the lady who was taking care of the lady who was in his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was that he was that he was <unk> and the ambulance along with the E.R. they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, in the stomach.
But I followed with my work.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking parking parking lot where my car was going to go home. So I did something that I didn't do normally, as I didn't do normally, something that I didn't do normally, is that time.
It went through the emergency room service home.
And then another nurse, I didn't know that I was taking care of the lady <unk> before, but another one said to me three words, those three words that most emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists fear too, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and we see the surgical patients.
The three words are: <unk> <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other other nurse with total <unk>
And "Well, she <unk> the same tone tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and the edge of death.
By the time of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high high and she had a driver and his family called the <unk> the ambulance were brought to the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure -- what it means is a shock of severe <unk>
barely breathe and it was blue.
The emergency staff would have all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise the blood pressure.
They put a <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and waiting for all hope they were <unk>
And in the two or three days of the next three days, it was clear that they never want.
He had a permanent <unk>
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was going on.
And to the ninth day, he was going to go. He said, wife and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks after that, I was embarrassed by that, and I experienced for the first time the shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat single, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and it never makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I am sure I <unk> the things and made sure I didn't get <unk>
And I kept holding those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did it choose medicine?
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in a <unk> day, it opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not to make more errors, I would let those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> at the emergency department in a community hospital in North Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
He looked at his throat, I was a little <unk>
He took him out of penicillin and sent it to his house.
But while he went to the door following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> my head asked to speak with me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
<unk> the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but it can cause the close to those tracks.
He said, fortunately, don't <unk>
You know, antibiotics is <unk> <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was taken to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation of them.
It turned out an X-ray of kidneys but it turned normal. A colleague of mine who was checking the patient, <unk> some sensitivity in the bottom quadrant, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read the liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to get it to it.
I looked at it and when I saw some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case is <unk>
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
I'm embarrassed and not support.
And here's the problem: if I can't tell you, and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach this to not make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure, unless we failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you're not going to hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, whatever she would have hard to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
<unk> of mistakes.
It is the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the fact that they don't sleep and the ones that I know -- those who have <unk> and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, which you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take the medicine to the people that make errors, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical <unk> and medical errors to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Stanford Toronto that I wrote for my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes all the days happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right, in a system in which religious infections, are increasingly <unk> and death.
In this country, 24 people die in this country, 24,000 <unk> <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system, where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the patient with a pain in his chest, and it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath of alcohol and, suddenly, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms as well.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professionals to error, well, it will not be anyone.
And with that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- it's a custom of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the chief of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
And their students <unk> <unk> the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, you know human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn about what happened to teach others.
It brings their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and for the support of support to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, we make mistakes of mistakes.
And I feel so much but I'm trying to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember that.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day of <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I made a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose an average American -- it's about 70 percent a day.
Not a lot ago, in a research followed for a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks of these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, it was <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or so.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about their elections.
Do you know how many people belong to the <unk> or how many of a <unk>
How do we figure out how to deal with those <unk>
Today, I want to talk about one of the greatest problems of <unk> choosing to the ice <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When you do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you do a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> at least at that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water -- and this was when we took water from the <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked me, why don't I buy nothing?
This is the shelf of <unk> oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> they came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different classes.
<unk> a post for <unk> right at the store.
We put there <unk> <unk> or 24 tastes different and we looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when he had been <unk> over 60 than when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were only three percent of the three to buy <unk>
What stopped when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> -- less is good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the <unk> issue of choices will affect us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when we don't get <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the savings decisions for about a million Americans, in between about 650 plans of this country.
And we were interested in seeing if the number of money funds available into savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program, to people to save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of educational funds, there were fewer participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered a few <unk> the rate of participation went to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choices, more people will be engaged by avoiding the stocks or the hedge funds.
As much as there was more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But no one of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are striving to do to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we make the decision that the <unk> even when this is against the self-interest.
They are more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick up more <unk> even though they're objectively the best.
The main reason is that we would be looking at that huge range of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choosing that amazing <unk>
Today, I want to tell you four simple techniques that we have, in a way or another, in different research, so you can use them in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, than less is more.
People are always disturbed when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to be cut, to get rid of <unk> choices, there will be an increase in marketing, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation eliminated the products for <unk> of cats -- less than <unk> they have increased the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and under cost.
You know that those in the average of today, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, there's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world today is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a type of tomato sauce, in tin.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how we manage the best choices is the <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a safe fund of life.
Those who really want to choose from, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they won't be able to make their <unk>
This session, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people to the people in this audience a holiday with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to get back, and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Any one that's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really wanted to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, which in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of choices, which is <unk>
So for people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete, very concrete, a very concrete way.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use them?
Because it doesn't seem like real money.
It turns out that it turns out to be seen more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to have more positive people.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> at a <unk> plan.
At the meeting of that meeting exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that they gave the staff to think about the positive things that we would think about their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> account.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway,
We saw that in supermarkets, along the <unk> of the <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of way to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to be <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
<unk> Okay, so on.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know anything?
This rating framework is totally useless.
<unk> must indicate something to <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those massive lists of funding.
You're supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than what we think, is just a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that enables <unk> altogether.
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box.
What I'm going to do is change the order that the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, a few thousand boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, four feet to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what about <unk>
What are you doing?
If you <unk> always the default button in every decision, it indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the flaw over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where the information is presented.
If we started how easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we pick the box of change doesn't tell you anything about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways, kind of made us to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> eliminating alternative alternate alternatives -- to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help us manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who turn their own business.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East Eastern Germany, if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
I had to record a piece of text text written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a <unk> written with the wrong message to the origin of the idea.
So in the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this is <unk> freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer in any big manufacturer and print one page, that page will end up having some yellow <unk> on every page that follow a pattern of one and a printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the net.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can set up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online online, but they do it by illegal media using <unk> <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk> computer.
The secret secret of America, two months ago, the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely that any of us are a victim of a crime than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is <unk>
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them to motivate them to motivate you.
And groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a role on the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority from the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They took the security of the site and inherit a <unk>
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government of the Dutch government -- I asked one of the leaders if they were to <unk> the death of people because of the attack for <unk>
And the response of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you do <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign foreign authority.
And they were issuing <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters who were <unk> the <unk> secret police headquarters on April 2011, and during the State of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian Egyptian government to intercept a large scale to the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to be able to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see the entire communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems bad, but I really don't really affect because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing that <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be able to rely on our governments today in 2011, any right to be present today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to be concerned about the next 50 years.
So this is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South African part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi does not have fences in the largest part of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we got up in the morning, and we found it very bad because it was the only relieve we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and that's why we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
People dying are warriors who protect our community and won, and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park, in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at the age of nine to the <unk> is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought of lions gave them fear.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because I even helped the lions see the pen <unk>
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But the lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they came back, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed in animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that you would turn out and turn the lights out.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load battery battery and battery <unk> the electricity in the little box. I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give up, because that's where lions.
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking down the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never went back to the problem with lions.
And the homes in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and the lions and asked me if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using to eliminate elephants from the farms.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds, and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that don't have it, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in the 1990s from the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see flying airplanes and he said that someday I would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer in aviation and a pilot when we <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a little bit of <unk> CA: <unk>
<unk> I know that they were invented <unk> <unk> but I want to do my own.
CA: So you know, you know, once you do it once, right? And I've tried it -- I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to get it on every step that I was going to have my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> nothing."
And I was very proud.
At school, we went all over time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought it would happen all my life in North Korean until it was all changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution here.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister <unk>
I said, "When we did this, the five family members will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
He was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time I was walking in front of the train, station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
One woman without life was dead on the street, holding a little boy standing in his arms looking at his mother's face, no power to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine went into North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They were also made more and more frequent the momentum of energy, everything around it was completely <unk> at night except for sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light, and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korean photo in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the edge of North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river may be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I would see bodies floating on the river.
I can't tell you the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the famine years I was sent to China to live with premature kin.
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous because the refugees North Koreans were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny.
One day, my worst nightmare was made, actually, when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I went on to a police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to wrap up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to each other, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North people in China are looking at asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though the <unk> had eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't get so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't had so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all their world can fit in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to be fighting to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because 67 years of <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call <unk>
Even though we went to life in South Korea was not easy, made a plan. I started to study for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to invite my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities, <unk> some money I sent to my family, and, as blame my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I began to plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Asia.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to find it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, he <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and locked across the border illegally.
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But the family was arrested and locked up again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison for the embassy of the South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so stunned that a stranger would mind asking him to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went into the ATM, and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North Koreans and taking them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I told me.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the people who are <unk> when they more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people are needed to.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Asia.
But its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English community work, and more.
We can also act like the bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us still keep in contact with family relatives and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans, all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the south.
This is Center Center for <unk> stores and negative food, <unk> land.
And then the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed Los Angeles by South, as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk> land.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, the Los Angeles Center home to the places of food to lead and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to bring them paid more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in the Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was pleased to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel like if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home -- you see the effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as cars <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> as <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest.
In a land where we call a <unk>
This is 45 me from 45 me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come on, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to go on.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put them together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine vegetables <unk>
What we do -- we are a kind of <unk> group made out of gardeners of all the <unk> all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone <unk>
The city meet me on top and <unk> I gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, <unk> <unk> made a justice order.
And I was saying, "Come on in it?
A court order for planting the food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's give it up.
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition at <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more land.
It has <unk> <unk>
That means 20 <unk>
That's enough enough to plant <unk> million gas plants.
Why the Earth does not seem like this?
You have a plant to give a few thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to the result.
It's my <unk> when I say to people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for south.
I grew up there. He took my children there.
I was invited to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Like a <unk> artist which <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, land, as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You would see what the earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became an education tool, the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night and were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I told you, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when you see people that I was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why why do I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, <unk> no, I'm not afraid to go to <unk>
So that's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a bomb shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, I gave me their stories about how it was affected and how they used to plant his mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has reached maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a <unk> like 50 people coming from, work and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If the kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow some tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if nothing of this will be <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're stuck with. I see color guys that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't lead nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are engaged in their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You may be producing the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to carry <unk> and turn them into healthy volume.
I didn't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to put people working on the people, to get the guys out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor to grow their own food, by opening their own food, by opening markets by farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you get them to take their <unk> right?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, don't be called me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk to you some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably will all agree with me that this is a very beautiful road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as today, when it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water at the asphalt that you can do with it.
And especially if you go on on your bicycle and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we built roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road here.
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is <unk> a material that we use now in most of the Netherlands, in the Netherlands, have pores and water can pass through it, so all the water water flow out into the sides and they will have a road so that it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water never else.
Noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet path.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road the rocks of the surface <unk>
I first got a stone, and then a lot more and more and more, and so on, and you will say, well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
You know, of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can see here really how the damage comes out in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between the stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they're <unk> they're going to be <unk> and they will be separating from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
So to solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into little bits, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of wool wool into it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat up, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is they have to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks are <unk> back to the surface.
I used an <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show, which I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tested a lot of samples out there, and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to get it out.
So you donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a lane test to test this stuff.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road last several years without any damage -- that's what we know of practice.
We took many samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made a lot of payload in them, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fibers of steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the highway surface -- you can actually save a lot of money on the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it acts the repair of it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to me as BBC News in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> of Afghanistan and made the girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so nobody could suspect where we were born.
We had to hide the books in the market bag so that it looks like it would look like it would seem to seem to look like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us, in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we had our lives, our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every time when the school was <unk> suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it was <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in his daughter, my mother, my mother and why his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can get it to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we shall.
So, you still want to be <unk>
I'm just 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the <unk> and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was his home to the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just complaining about my university degree, but I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who is driving by the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have a big sleep, but my family has even more great dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls going to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though it was still in front of an unfortunate opposition.
Like <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from the way to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When he got to his house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending his daughter to school, he would go back to try.
<unk> already, if he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given to Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and that he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school today, remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to the school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
We knew that these changes didn't take a lot after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, the <unk> I see a future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day, the <unk> girls would get it to me.
Like me, they dream of big.
Thank you.
I'd never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back, a <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
An forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and out of the country to call a anger and start a revolution against the regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> they were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a <unk> in the face of the <unk> <unk>
You have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a few lost losses, we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of modern society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a inclusive and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation and national dense.
There was about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> almost 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about development development and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> for the <unk> a movement of women, <unk> orientation leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by the right of the <unk> for democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than <unk> of <unk> and <unk> policies.
Over time, our initiative was FDA bright, successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little by little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day of the <unk> of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of official army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violation of the prisoners and their lack of respect for the law.
Our society, shaped by a <unk> mindset, but it has been away from the ideal and the principles of freedom, the social justice, we had social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today for <unk> with our history of success and <unk> and elections.
I'm now here today to confess that we, as nation, we choose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and Eileen <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated political policies of domination and <unk> both men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the election, which is just the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the relative representation of the female more to need the representation of <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as an outrage of outrage and call a anger.
We need to begin to act like compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse -- not just <unk> but also putting the <unk> instead of <unk> in place in place of <unk> the collaboration rather than the <unk>
These are the ideal that a Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately needs the end of achieving peace.
Because peace has an alchemy of us, which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between the women's perspectives and the male ones.
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before it <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of it, has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that unfolds all the humanity that men and women, that all the tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all the existence.
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> it <unk>
This is what it is like, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
What are everyone going to do is the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question that has an equally <unk> response.
It is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the ones that everyone is doing is why she's left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
He was 22 years old, he had been <unk> at the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York for my first work as a writer and the editor at the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my soul -- <unk> my head with a <unk> loaded with rubber <unk>
The man, who I loved most in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at the Harvard University, and I have a <unk> <unk> <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies for the list of <unk> <unk> between they Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can move to anyone, every races, all religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in relationships and <unk> and <unk> or said in another way, in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who had it, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence that the other ages, and over 500 women and girls are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting on my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he was also just <unk> from a college <unk> university and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk> guy.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved the whole of me -- I was so ready that I had gone to Harvard, that I would put a passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I <unk> I quit my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that it was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was getting into a <unk> and financial trap and a little psychological story.
The next step in the form of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to do, I had to feel so safe he bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept it underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that it needed those <unk> for the trauma that lived in small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But these guns were actually a message for me and even though I never had taken away my hand, my life was actually serious danger, every minute in every day.
The first physical <unk> attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was the seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises from my neck had <unk> I put my mother in my mother and married me with him.
In spite of what it happened, I was sure that we would live happily forever, because I loved it, and he wanted a lot of a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that I had a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent twice as much in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving toward a secret beach, and I was <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I would spend several times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon <unk> and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying. at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was using me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help us face her <unk>
The other question that everyone does do is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we are the victims we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim has finally put the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent harassment, even after the <unk> has gone back to a marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time on their mother.
And yet, we continue asking why it's just not going?
I was able to <unk> because of one last <unk> up that defeating denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the police, to the police, my neighbors, to my friends and family -- and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> the victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say "The fault is it by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> I have heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also reported that they learned a compelling lesson of what happened to them and to make their lives <unk> joyful lives and happy as wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I was going to marry with a cute little guy and kind and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do to you is never going to be going to have ever more -- it's probably a charged gun pointing out to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, as you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you, there are a few people, that I'm listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, to his sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
<unk> thrive in the silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of light talking about it with their children, their fellow work, their friends and family.
They would take their view of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims out of the safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like this.  Hopefully I brought clothes for <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get it right now, but we'll figure it out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. Very much less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater because of the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything when you cover your head.
All right.
Why do I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this photo.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
He was totally uncomfortable and the photographer would tell me that he was going to get my back, and I would give it to the hair of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery, or a <unk> <unk> like the one I made two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our aspect, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave it means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model of a model.
Because I'm a beautiful and white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> I was discovered, but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry -- which we're biologically programmed to <unk> also that we have associated with a high and <unk> shape -- and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> I've known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> from the fashion that <unk> Stop. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York I told every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just about four percent, not white -- not white percent.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can you be a model when you grow up.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't care about that.
But then what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is: Why?
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon and poet, what would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this list a spectacular list still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the American executive executive or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is like saying that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've finished your studies, and you have a copy and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, you know, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but you have a Model T Model <unk> for 10 years, people would be <unk>
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much about all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're moving into the personal space, but it was a child.
So he looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party. a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and the <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're a bunch of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all his <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do to do is make things for free?
I have too much six inches and I never use, except the few days, but the privilege that I get is I get the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and I was given my <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for power to keep <unk>
It was <unk> of these privileges by my aspect, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of the <unk> teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York City, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk> and <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I learned that at the 53 of the age of 13 years in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent of the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of an model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little <unk> and you have the most brilliant hair, you have very happy and wonderful hair.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious and <unk>
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, you know, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant legs.
You just have to meet with a group of models, because you have the most bright legs and your clothes in the fashion -- but you're probably the physically <unk> women on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to look at a situation of racial oppression when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was more enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go on the <unk>
There was no directors of <unk> or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum <unk>
In fact, most of them were taken random tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That is the corner of <unk> and <unk>
He happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
This is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to give us the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a full stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is just a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than displays of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in a week from October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only on the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it feels and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something we expect with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the tent that <unk> in the previous days of <unk>
And I was described to me what there was about five years of foot in that same place.
We knew that he remembered their beating heart with the strength of seeing that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in conscious creation.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in a lot of the family photos.
I am always the one who takes a picture.
Today, I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't want to go on to get to someone and ask it, and you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs as characters -- silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with the Parliament Parliament. But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They're hardly <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> you have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There's the <unk> of the New World that are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural waste.
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria they help absorb the anthrax that they were not going to be for them and caused huge losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there is no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous important importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto and the <unk> in Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> <unk> in places like Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead, or wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, it is <unk> and the reason is because they are <unk> by livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned by the veterinary use in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of the street in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time bomb.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the <unk> lake.
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade trade, dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are researching <unk>
We're trying to determine the basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so I focus on a business problem is not going to be able to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise. They can write a letter to their government and tell them, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you're going to tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with your kids, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed it because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we played with it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got to seed seeds in southern Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that descends into the River River, and we teach the local growing tomatoes and we teach local tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were convinced that the locality in such a fertile valley, had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that I was able to do that, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  It <unk> in time to save the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato to grow this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling them, "Look at how easy it is to be <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and the red night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you do it, you never get <unk>
I thought we were only Italians to make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the names were, what the names were doing, what the ones were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt very proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
We would see the <unk> --  <unk> see the waste that we gave to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root of the root that means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I'm trying to deal with any of a different culture as if it was my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if it was my <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk> chef.
That book gave me a slap in the face. The little one is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all the economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to do the 27 years only to answer the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never start anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and it feels like the people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We came together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is it going to do to you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for one time instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for a time, they were <unk> but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, which opportunity have <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't bring to their public meetings.
What do we do is we work with one, and we work face -- you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor in the company, the family doctor of the business -- who came with you in his house, at the table of their kitchen table, and that helps to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to move away from this <unk> <unk> where we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so the name is <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business managers, business <unk> in history, died in '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economics economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the public spirit.
So now we have a <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most important people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to talk to you.
You have to give you a sense of privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then you have to be <unk>
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk to you about is this morning, what is you <unk>
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we think about it: <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that was a <unk> magazine -- many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the <unk> year they gathered this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York at 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York wouldn't have been within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve, and they looked at it, if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses.
They were already <unk> in animal -- so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that was <unk> in New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States, they showed up <unk> generic companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then later you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company, the largest company, has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to sell it to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing -- and you have to count with a fantastic financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was not born.
We've looked at the <unk> and looked at the 100 companies of the world by <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
Never the word came, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in the coffee <unk> along with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what somebody did for you, what somebody did for this <unk> who talk about this <unk> what does it take?
What can you do that? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." He looks for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us are around us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why we don't get a lot of knowledge -- even though we share the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we lend and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries ago, and I trust a city.
And there's always <unk> the music.  There is a film in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the greatest amount of abandoned properties.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected death.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this made me a deep gratitude for the living time.
It gave him clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I was trying to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old people and new friends turn the wall of this house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> Before they die <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with it and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk> by <unk>  Before I died, I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to do it once more."
Before I died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
So this abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hopes and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in ways new and <unk> it's about to <unk> the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started to get hundreds of the passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit and now have made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of improvement. It's more important than ever before, to find ways of conserving the perspective and to remember that life is brief and fragile.
<unk> is something we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that make us more power.
If you think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us, cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is a high and very <unk>
Not speech, but transmits joy that some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
It shares it -- it will happen what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at color color.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and look at this -- it's never <unk>
When singing the songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I didn't even know, I could tell me one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very <unk>
They gave the most <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady Lady <unk>
Don't seem amazing?
But most people don't.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, if you wouldn't consider it within it, it could only mean one thing -- which was autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, in learning, and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests in a different form of a different way, so that you will be <unk> so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster into the world, there is no cause and any known idea.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and actually didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> living and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the machine, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that there was <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a kid who saw the world without biases, a human being had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about <unk> and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that gives us the difference and the fact that being different doesn't mean that anyone is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and for Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inner and, frankly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher, which was a class of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  It was really <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big <unk> words.
But in the developed of those conversations, I felt what we had, must have felt that he fell down the <unk> hole and saw the door to a new world.
<unk> I felt when I had those conversations with the students. It was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted other people to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenges -- from energy to the environment and healthcare and health care, and if we don't know about this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do it with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and so what?
I mean, why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that would make them <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate that science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do -- the bullets are killed and kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supported too much in the area of the language of our brain, and we <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower, <unk>
And the trick here is to use a simple phrase, <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you will provide graphs that will apply to our other senses, and you create a deeper sense of understanding what you get.
I think these are just a few key keys that can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists, and engineers, when they have solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words across the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor <unk> of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge -- no matter what, when he won, he gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy who was <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
He was thrown into the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end he had a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first single use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after the independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
Didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
You put all kinds of suggestions that you could have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> from the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about proven quality.
And not even with it they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen by King by a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of us, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
He read the diary of a poor <unk> and he always wore this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King if he does not give him his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more poor, more unfortunate than it came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title. There was only before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate was <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would be serious about a <unk> <unk> like President <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as a President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to stay there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> we may keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this -- I want to tell you -- is that the title of President Americans doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So ultimately he won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness for then.
But you know how many nations are now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the Kansas House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they are now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give you a <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes the words much more the words than they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 meters on the ground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is uploaded to heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about it, but above all, that cacophony of male and stones and stones with graphic tools.
Like others, I have a cheap flashlight of light <unk> he holds his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless feet into that hole.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep deep in that hole by risking their lives without pay, and often dying.
I went home from that hole, and I went home but they may never will, because they are prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the G8 <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as a grade.
When we ended up talking to me -- I was very sad, I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a stomach <unk> and weeks later, I went to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that currently there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much the amount of Africans displaced throughout the entire attempt <unk>
A hundred years ago, the cost of a farmer of a farmer was about three times the annual salary for a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
However, today you can save entire families for generations of <unk> for 18 <unk>
Surprisingly, slavery generates revenues from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises and better work for us to find out that they are forced to work without paying them under threat and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operates in <unk> goods produced for slaves and they have value, but the ones that are producing are disposable people.
The slavery exists in almost everyone and yet illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
So this strange show and formidable show, was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was <unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, extended entire families -- in a heavy overcoat of <unk> stack of mechanically bricks in their head, until 18 in their head, until 18 at the same time, and they take them from <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> made it <unk>
So <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning -- and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment that these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, none of them.
I was not the civil of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for his release and he trusted you to <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my <unk> heart.
In the Himalayas I found kids <unk> rocks for miles by <unk> until they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids than the charge and the children would put them into their heads with straps <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing with what they <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> their homes.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, I would tell me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk> sex.
I made me a little bit of the stairs <unk> that I was going to give this basement <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in craft, they're local for prostitution.
They have small, small, private, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every name is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and at that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs in which it was <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows and big enough to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, as we touch a subject so hard, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people going on in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often relate to the labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families to do it in the trade of the silk.
This is a family portrait of it.
The black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My <unk> told me his stories.
We have no <unk> they were told.
We still hope, though, is able to go out of this house someday and go somewhere else where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what appeared to be a fishermen family on a boat, two younger brothers, some young kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families -- <unk> <unk> and forced them to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to it was <unk> it was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of the trees immersed in Lake <unk> often trap networks and kids, and with fear -- they thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
Because of fear of his love is not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the slaves younger under their command.
I met these guys at the five of the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it would be pointing out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they are packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
We asked us to push it on a land path to the forest.
At the end of the road, we would get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed down this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the path.
As we started down, we took the <unk> that he took the way back and after walking around an hour of an hour we found that the way was <unk> for the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I put it into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> the road ended up <unk> on one of the room, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had kids bound on their back, and while they were looking for gold, they sell them into the waters <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well, they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people have heavy stone bags they will then be transported to another area where they <unk> the rock to be able to extract the gold.
At the first sight, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer at the side, we see to work at other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this guy will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When his uncle died, he <unk> the debt of the uncle who force it to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the mines 14 years and the lesion of the leg that you see here is the product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that physicians would say that he should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has to be liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote possibility -- what inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we would have testimony about them and that we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it makes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> They're people, real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I would not think about these so many beautiful people, and I have had the great honor to meet.
I hope these images take a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast in slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like the management,
No one knows what the hell do we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> dancers --  that we'll see later on.
But a degree demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at their time, was a virtuous dancer dancer dance.
In the last few years there have been much progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we will know if there really exists a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so they don't have the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of the clinical trials, they never have been done.
And what if the patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test for ourselves?
It doesn't need a <unk>
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinical clinic.
So what I want to do is -- as well as not conventional for a try, you see, in a certain sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the <unk> of the <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds like talking to you -- we can imagine as a dancers of a vocal fracture, because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the <unk> for example.
And as the Gothic did it require an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of the vocal cords as <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
In the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake a paleontologist, and <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- they are both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but also the exams that are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it shows mass scale.
These are some incredible secret goals to address.
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties in the patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk>
With high monitoring we could get objective data.
We could do <unk> mass of low-cost clinical trials for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving us the first steps in that respect, we are launching the <unk> <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have food lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or no Parkinson's -- it can call low price, and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: And so I <unk> by taking all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max
You see, you see, some people may not get <unk> You may not get it out.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion in looking for the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy at this moment?
So much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on mobile phone phone as well, what we need the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, he was <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're generic creatures gray.
We were <unk> in the dark, in rooms without windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin -- even more perfect -- we can do the impossible, possible and get rid of the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a true taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where he was <unk> There were <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 of May, I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village sitting in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level has reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. And we took the mud and we leave the lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We loved it, and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and chambers and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
You know, you bring them to different places of villages around the villages for <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While we were <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped me clean up <unk> the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there were the honor and I had the honor that that day he was <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and confusing, I had heard about the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't going beyond my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some who had more than a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to have a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
And at the end of the time, they got a little bit more pictures and it needed more <unk> so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries were offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got <unk> a village neighbor in North <unk>
Once a week, we used our scanner in the libraries of temporal libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
So the time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on of course the <unk> of the photos.
I could get an hour. I could get a couple of weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand using the <unk> and the areas that the color and detail the water was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered from bacteria, with algae -- even with oil, all of it along with the step of time I continue to <unk> so it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean, dry and had been <unk> for his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have the guidance of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was very lucky in relation to the photos.
I had started to <unk> her, but he stopped when they realized that the <unk> even more.
It also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been able to be able to do it, and we were able to get the images into a single photo and put it up the whole picture.
When we picked up their photographs shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photos on a fire station, in the rubble very far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would have it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Her children small, not so small now, but his two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find all his family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave him his little son his son down 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could see -- something that he could go back to look, something that I could think of the past day that I would not have been on the summer day, when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up to hand more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority came to their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us return to 90 hundred hundred <unk> pictures of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars into teams and materials, most of them on ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One photo is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone loved.
They're <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take us but the first thing that we will look for.
This is the project, of restore little pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture comes back to someone, there is an enormous difference in the life of the person that you get it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something larger, to give something larger, using their talent to something they won't be sexually models.
To finish up I would like to read this email -- I sent him a Cindy day that came back from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about the people and the stories shown in the imagery.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother and my daughter <unk> hangs <unk>
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs is the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> really inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition in an exhibition just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a thousand million a second.
Let me give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video at slow motion from light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray X-rays, and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and you switch it into a <unk> <unk> -- in various <unk> to create a video package of photons just a millimeter wide size.
And that <unk> package will travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this photons package and we shoot in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what takes it to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  So so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
So the pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons package that starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light <unk> goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
In that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the <unk> of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and current and we make them go down the same distance and we see it at slow to about 10 billion times, how much they think would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie -- a <unk> <unk>
And what about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> on the table and the <unk> wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a composition of <unk>
But if you look at once more and more of this tomato sauce, you realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> you keep <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and it turns out to go out after various <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is on their mobile phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to be <unk>
What do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo on the <unk> it comes very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest show -- so just going into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over and over and again with a very <unk> <unk> we take those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of this data on the raw data and make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, other heroes.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and you <unk> the light on the door.
And after the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances all the way to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point corresponds to what point corresponds to the distance.
So when you project a laser can record a big photo -- you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object.
We will be able to see it 3D printed?
This is our well-being.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that would make collisions with what is going on the curve, and that's what he is going on the curve, on.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light reflected into the open windows <unk>
Or we could build <unk> and we could be able to see the inside of the body of <unk> <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood, this is pretty hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> like a new manufacturing event to solve the problems of imagining healthcare in the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became science in art, an art of photography.
I realized that all the <unk> data that we harvest are not just for scientific visualization, but we can see that we can be able to have scientific visualization, but we can see it.
So create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and DNA code.
And let's look at those waves, remember, time between each one of those waves is just about <unk> of a second.
But here's something fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> they go back from us.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
And it turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have happy to see this image.
The order in which the events happen in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
So let's make the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and you give you free freedom.
With a mobile phone, it can make a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and it gets to <unk> and make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering it for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who has a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> A Android, a wow! wow!
It's a lot. Most of you today have a mobile phone.
But I'm going to talk to you today about my cellphone, and how do I change my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 degrees lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This organization says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider in Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use our mobile phone, where we are.
This whole information is stored at at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your Internet provider or your Internet provider will be stored at the Internet.
And in all Europe people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone service providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, "You know, don't <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for me to tell me all the information they had on me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't have a focused response. It was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, you agree.
They <unk> the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand people -- 30 percent of information.
I first saw it and I said, well, it's an enormous file, OK.
But after a while I realized that's my life.
There are six months of my life in this file.
Was it a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, "I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can come up and zoom in, go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I give it.
And you can see how I'm going to go on on the train to <unk> and what often I call the journey.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not only about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she called, we talk a couple times.
Then they call me some friends and they call me each other.
And then one is called the other, and the other one on the other, and we ended up with this big communications network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other and what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see this whole thing.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who's talking to "Who who send an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known to me in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never happen.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information of us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go back home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not very fashion.
When they go home, they <unk> their representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that serve them to remember they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
Not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why they <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, though they are.
It's just by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm not <unk> I'm not a source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish being a disabled person.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas, they're at the shopping mall, they drive in circles, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled people.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the C. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian Muslim woman, a woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I would like to walk from my home to New York City.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> -- <unk> dance.
If my three family sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three family sisters were going to the public school, my parents would go to the school system and get rid of that I was also outside, and if we didn't take away all the ultimate score all <unk> my mother.
My father taught me how to walk in the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and simply walking.
The other approach I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that we had it.
The <unk> that I carry into was very strong.
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion that has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 and they're still in the family --  I think no one realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think right to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
But yet it seemed to be a lot to be a lot that was a lot to be hungry during the <unk>
I was telling them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating -- so <unk> at the dawn is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On the summer morning, I was often about <unk> so I was drinking milk, so I would drink cold cups on the back, I went back into the <unk> Sea <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a stand-up comedian and I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can take you on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I made all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the maximum note in my lectures, and also in his class.
Every time I was doing a scene of the glass sheet my faculty <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> in order to have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end, it was <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk>
I went to <unk> by the head of the theater department, crying as if someone had killed my cat, how to ask me why and she told me that because she would believe that they could not make the <unk>
And I said, "You know, if I can't do stunts -- you can't do the <unk>
It was a piece of paper that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without cerebral palsy, and he was given to an actor.
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors.
Al <unk> went home, and my first <unk> tour, was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> it didn't look at me more than the <unk> and it was obvious for me that directors of <unk> not <unk> actresses, and <unk> with disability.
Just <unk> for perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the ruler.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made me <unk>
In my first tour, I made drawings of New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when she fell at the point that he was at high speed for the highway in New Jersey with a driver who had cerebral palsy, and he had <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little sound rumor that women are not fun, and they find really fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother, and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York City now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and the time to remind the assembly principals that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight against the stigma challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by wire, it has Keith <unk>
I went out as if I went to a college dance, I went to a study and sat at a <unk>
I looked at the CEO and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held on the news desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, and I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't go back to me.
But not just Mr. <unk> he went back to <unk> but he went on like my <unk> he had my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never get <unk> of me and a bigger or older.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I'm going to play clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk>
What does it have?
We really should be praying for her."
One <unk> suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
Disability is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make it <unk> then you can't make somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that I didn't get <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I had grown up with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that we could create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the entire society to teach our children.
My tortuous journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet, by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world -- Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in terms of the great state of New Jersey in 2008.
And I started "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give children refugee refugees a tiniest part of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I would like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small village in South America?
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the little village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there is no work, or perspectives in future.
He ends up living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year later, nothing.
One day the guy is about a man who offers him take him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
They went to a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money so that they bought new clothes -- money to send home to their family.
They presented a young guy.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That kid in that small village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were <unk> an organization connected to Al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a kid in a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that he arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled him out of what we call the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed urban planners that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who seek something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't afford to opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do pretty much.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, "Well, if I never had gone?
And if I had seen me forced me to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually in order to go to the youth leaders at a business table.
They went to a few <unk> juveniles <unk>
We sat there and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, that because he was a college college going, frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the greatest hurdle for the point A is the street.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started beating up to the local residents who normally couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to go to hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think that his ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> spirit, and I believe that the business spirit may be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
They will encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so quickly.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> -- we were from plastic sent out from the stranger.
If you beat someone, "When did the last time you saw <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather <unk>
And he started the flowers for flowers to create gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now he's working in the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he didn't grow pink ones, because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, to work for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit, a great way, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to guide them into the development and put it out of their business.
They will give young people with the resources they need to support the support that they need to move from understanding to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park. In the <unk> that's how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and maintain the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people into entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> from the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> in the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun was made that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it will not be the way that we were able to <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful <unk> lake, when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with <unk> hearts with <unk> <unk> balls of aluminum <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy like to pull out what they had had, who thought he was going to clean their <unk>
That question remained with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where you get the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our garbage, the reason for 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who I did that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
And I traveled in the trucks and walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot of it, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get a lot of more.
So I started working like <unk> <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I was <unk>
And we <unk> the escalators and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong one is going to happen quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of regulators -- the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving in the traffic all day and pass humming around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often go on the truck and cause terrible things.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force in nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a breathing way or circulation.
You must always be in motion.
And it's the stigma.
I think the stigma is especially ironic because I believe that waste waste is the most important hand hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste out of the waste and effective and effective every day, this starts to <unk> their <unk> and their dangers itself will threaten us in very real ways.
We have been controlled for decades, and centuries and centuries and they start to <unk>
The economics needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old stuff, we don't have a space for the new thing that the engines of the economy start to fail when it's in harm's way.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointing your relationship.
And then what I call our average speed is necessary.
And I mean just at the speed that we used to move on in the <unk> time.
We don't usually have <unk> or <unk> <unk> or we have our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that it would take from that.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and put it into that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us in except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection on the street, I grabbed my son, and I went down the stairs running and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper like he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the garbage collection and I went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe it was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and have all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The municipal waste what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to look at someone whose work is to clean the crap of you, take a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a number of stories in the capital of Ethiopia, the Addis Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because of the <unk> of crystals generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, it looks nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a place that rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I really was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure of free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building from several floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge came to the survey of the site, which is located in a very large area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the entries in the building.
And this spreads out with an improbable atrium, which creates a space of free air in the building that was <unk> by their own way, and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with little businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how did the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric that was similar to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air to air and also the light, but in a <unk> fashion.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
So we're building that with these little <unk> pieces, which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these tiny <unk> of colors that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But ultimately we all realized that this market idea was going to be much more profitable than the mall because in the end of the mall there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economically, not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary for air <unk>
So we get some savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a great advantage to putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the ceiling as a new public space with areas and bars and bars that would create this oasis of urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which together gather water for the <unk>
They're waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the bigger that I have to have, needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I made special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 doors connected with almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation, we did was broaden the existing streets, creating 12 initial building blocks and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of them -- we select a few points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last one was thinking about the cell, the little cell cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the weather climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European building and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then at the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local rules that set up a higher density on higher levels and lower density at the ground level.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community that is occupied by construction.
It is where all the neighbors, can go up and get them to make activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life lives changes the communities and economies at the same rate that we grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have the goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a lot of very bright hair, and a very bright <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the state capitals very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I had a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon and I was a little bit late and I was <unk> in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took the table from my teacher to the grades.
And then, I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few case.
All like this.  And I set it back to the book by <unk> but to see, some of my other fellows had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all in rows of <unk> and I was a row out of a row -- just to be there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got <unk>
It's that everything was obvious.
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was struck by the reason why I was bothered by this little girl so small, it was so good for <unk>
I was shocked.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
You also forgot the birds -- birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of honor killings in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we would take the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So we have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which they are studying <unk> in all of their ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> -- there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> and I wouldn't have <unk>
I wouldn't have King <unk> or a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
I took the lists of secondary school, because we would be losing the <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> We would have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost all the one has all.
This year you get 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of the time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all you could possibly possibly have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the life of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being at the same time, and audience, we know exactly what details to get on the knife -- right?
<unk> make us all <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
Everything she does for me to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself, that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool gorgeous that <unk> can see in his lover -- he adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
<unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> you like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why I Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links very well.
When you <unk> it is in his <unk> agony of soon listening to the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the old text interpretation or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what they <unk> -- the more painful to the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us experience, it causes us a much more profound range and vital feelings that a wise man that can help us.
It's saying that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us open ourselves in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion we would love us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write over this later on.
One day, Freud went to a young woman who was being used with the idea that his woman was doing it.
And Freud said that there was something bizarre in that man, who didn't get sick in what his wife did.
So she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
So the novels described very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we became the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts and illegal.
<unk> are driven us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at eight years old, and I think about it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since the one who was sending himself horrible messages to itself, for a year.
For a year. A whole year.
She was trying to stand up to the new bride of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
What big, even if you think about creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a novel Mr. Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try and get the <unk> confused our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what could be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take a <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to take from your own and <unk> of what you ever need, and it's under the ground -- you get your name, it takes your <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not safe when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to the Wall Street <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> on Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius -- but it <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> it needs their aid, but they would do it and do it with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> you <unk> you all with your solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of it.
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't like to get their hands up.
It's one of the rare times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It looks like this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> like a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
At the next minute they're the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being he <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a issue of geometry, just a matter where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to forget the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Only fiction -- the jealousy.
The fiction used the <unk> invites the table.
And look at what you <unk> the sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July July of July 1969, Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the gray -- the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo was working about 400,000 people and asked the 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the crew of Apollo <unk>
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
I walked on the surface, which I was like, from the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have been a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 percent later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the very words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> they give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why is it <unk>
Why do it turn into our goal?
And you could also ask, why is climbing the more <unk>
35 years ago, why would we fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice play against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the contemporaries, the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the east of the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long checklist of technology.
The first half of the 20th century, the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and just eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of human history, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of the Apollo 10, 10 miles it flew at 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970s, any human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful joyful story about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that problems we imagine that technology was going to solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> of <unk> 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't get to <unk> from escape escape from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew this would be the latest mission of <unk> but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that thing to remind us about our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have distracted us and they had enriched toys, and things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But not <unk> the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that you have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that you have to have to give you up, to Microsoft, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that the risk capitalists offer to the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused that they would be able to make the creation of <unk> ideas, for <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred tiny investments, investment per minute that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is in the long term. They have not invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate free value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated, profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars would require a political decision that would be popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global consumption of energy is coming from sources of renewable energy sources, wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want some alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what politics and international treaties -- the development of a <unk> energy development, a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy, or international treaties that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem technological, they're not to be.
We know for time that famines are result in the failure of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affects <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can make things like crops or systems for the storage and labor supply, but there will be bad while there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon was declared war in 1971, but we suddenly discovered that there are many types of cancer, some incredibly resilient the treatment, and only over the last 10 years seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and -- but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it should be really about a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it is with those <unk>
But it's a model for the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no political like John Kennedy that <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like to explore the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be easy.
I was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We are alone in our present, and the future solutions will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start talking about the <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decrease of trust, it's a very generalized belief of it.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to talk to you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have dropped into some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to the surveys of opinion, and the surveys of opinion are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at surveys in opinion over time, there is no evidence of it.
I mean, the people that were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still get a lot of the judges, the nurses.
The rest of us in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But this is what enough?
What record polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people manifests when they ask some questions.
It was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would come to you, <unk> in the <unk>
Let's take it into the <unk>
It was on the teachers of <unk>
And probably <unk> by asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all those cases.
I could, for example, I would say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the class, but in no way to drive the school class.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave the whole knowledge when we think about trust in form more <unk>
I believe that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real real trust, because they try to <unk> the good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I wish you have more confidence in what you know about trust, but not what it isn't.
And I mean, I mean, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who have their savings with the very rightly called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it that you say, yeah, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing is a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, in the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can make certain things, but I see that they <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm really happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't got <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is that we're going to see before confidence.
Trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we have to do.
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional institutions, and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, let's take the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that I will go on in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the system accountability is destined to secure the top and the testing tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do difficult tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You must have all of you all know examples.
We put it all over the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were to be worthy of trust, and we give it to the people that we are reliable and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> what does not do <unk>
Third, the task.
You get to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve the confidence.
But the trust, in the end, is defining because they give us the <unk> other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give you the basis for enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't get rid of the general people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make a test test for you that you are worthy of confidence.
How do we do it?
That's done every day, everywhere, it makes it ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I had my socks on my socks -- says I can give you a <unk>
You take them and get it back to me and get the money, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're <unk> and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing out is not a very difficult thing.
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the early early back of computers we have come up with <unk> the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the screen world that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> increasingly and more, so that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how it was <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong force against the screen transfers their physical body <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool that is breaking the barriers.
But the two hands still remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
We put a transparent bombsight with cameras in depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift your hands of the keyboard, coming into the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in the real space, and that's as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and emphasize lines, or words with the virtual touch sensor, that there are down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come into us?
And so many of us would have bought and thought about things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical beings so that we could be able to get it and <unk>
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this single physical drum.
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of Rick <unk> <unk> bicycle and <unk>
And in programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, what it means is that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay for always in the physical world.
You can teach it physically and you can physically teach and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can be able to reproduce as a physical reality -- the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is most fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities together.
As you can see, digital information will not just show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to get rid of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we were we sequenced that barrier, the only limit that lies is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to give a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believe that there was only a <unk> path to the <unk> a safe job, and <unk>
No matter if I would like the work or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera singer
This was me, in my <unk>
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But any adult to give them the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends, my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15, I knew it was too much too much to train.
My dream was never <unk>
You know, that for the rest of my life a family happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted <unk> Okay.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what was the first books that I saw here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth story for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> because to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also gave rise to my reading habit.
You make a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map was out of place, because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's all the way into research as comparative comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't we do it as well in the daily life?
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For example, the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and duty <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> on the <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can make a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
My books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be going to feel like I used or <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Your most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where your passion, is where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm happy here -- I'm happy to live with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always are <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called Alex.
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch my office took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories, that Alex brought into the sessions, it made me easy to move the head while they hit the solution.
<unk> is the new <unk> saying, Alex, and why I would see her, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, you start home later, it has children later, even the death happens later.
For the <unk> like Alex and I had time to kill me.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex talking about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not like it to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> on the next.
Plus, the best moment to work in Alex marriage is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't cause the Alex <unk> to be a pause in its development.
This caused the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of mutual <unk> was a real problem and had real unintended consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they believe that no one comes to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> I want to see -- it's okay. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments <unk> that give their life to the time when they have 30 and <unk>
<unk> of more <unk> not <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on how much money they <unk>
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future couple of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage growth stage in their <unk> and it <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there is something they want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment of life and we know that the female fertility comes to the top of the 28, and the things become complicated to <unk>
The <unk> are the time for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which his daily life life has an impact on the person that they <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development, and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> <unk>
Journalists are <unk> names for the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens and absolutely nothing happens.
And then every day, smart <unk> interesting as you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, not good for me, but this relationship is not just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are in <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day that I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound like this: "My dating.
They were all running and <unk> but then somewhere around the 30, it turned the music and everybody started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds <unk> but not the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, choosing a mate, and you have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there is a research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful doing all of the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red sport cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want right now.
You know, you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he <unk>
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of what it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having an identity.
He said he'd like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed it more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living in a very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
It was often in our sessions, but then you get up the same when you say, "You don't choose your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well, a day his head came up on his legs and cried for almost all the hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had just spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words said, please call <unk>
He was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of if it gives me <unk>
At that time, I was very hard to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex and I worked with Alex as to just sit while the <unk> of Emma was going on.
So for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was <unk> of that identity crisis and <unk> identity.
By capital of identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to try to try it out.
I'm not <unk> the <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not count -- which, by the way, is not exploration, which by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you into the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the minds of the limit limit as soon as you know, what you know, what you know, how you think, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from the outside of its <unk>
The new things come from what they call weak ties friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family when he has a partner and there is a couple and there is their own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is better to sit out that 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to pick the person in which you live right now or tell you when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> is not progress.
The best moment to work in your marriage is before you get it, and that means being so intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill the time it will work or kill you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a room who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, with the living life.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married with a man who elected consciously <unk>
He <unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and sent me a letter that said, "Now the emergency spaces of emergency contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like airplanes that come out from the airport from Los Angeles, and they come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight candy fit in its trajectory the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 or even <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worthy of spreading all the <unk>
It's just as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma all the <unk> The <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital capital -- they get capital capital and use their links to your family.
They're not going to be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
You're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at high grade students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I work back, I would get grades.
What struck me the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance had no scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classrooms and went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios. And every study my question was, who does success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what they would do with the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would do, as far as possible in the competition.
We studied professors -- working in really difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, asking yourself, what of these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was the purpose.
<unk> is passion and perseverance to reach very long-term goals.
<unk> is a <unk>
<unk> is embracing your future, day after day, not just a week, not just by the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for over a year to see who they <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly higher likely to graduation, even when we put them in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the test tests -- even the security they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National <unk> of <unk> in which matter -- it's also in school, especially for kids at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How could we build it in children?
What should I do to teach kids a strong job ethic.
How do I keep doing it for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I do know is that talent don't give them purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the often is not related to or it's even related to the action lines.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> of growth."
This is a idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not flat, that can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start everything again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was overwhelmed by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> like the Great <unk> China.
Over the last few years, I've been asking me if I can break down this <unk> so that whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese may be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy for you.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read signals from traffic signals -- of restaurants, to understand the basic idea of web pages, or newspapers.
Now I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person going to go for a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, like it was shouting, <unk> <unk> -- I'm <unk> -- this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol look like a pair of doors in the <unk>
I call this <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretches his arms, this person is saying <unk> this <unk>
The person within the mouth, the person is <unk>
This is a broadcast such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker is a pretty idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two claps together, it's very hot.
Three claps together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
You have a door. You put a table inside the door, you get the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, you ask questions.
You have someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk> <unk>
So we've been at almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort you will be able to learn a couple hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese <unk>
So after I knew the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed in the origin, because Japan is in this China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains <unk> one on the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> to their political enemies, beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a way.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking about and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I came to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The film was given for months for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and get a magic wand of it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raising our children in a kind of a kind of <unk> industrial show.
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took up 40 years later with, interestingly on, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> kid who was <unk> to a girl dressed as an enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence on the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
Do you use magic shoes to defeat the armies were generated by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of the Oz is that the most vulnerable characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son.
Only three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  And so slid in the room and he was impressed like a mother leg with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So I would have a sense that Luke get an army to <unk> the government?
We had this with the magician of <unk>
How do it make it for Dorothy for Dorothy film?
If we do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It is the kind of world that I want my kids to grow out of them, OK?
Why is there so much force at least capital F, force in the movies for our kids, and so little from the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss.  I think at the moment of the first kiss.
My search has finished, I have a <unk>
Why do they stand there?
I don't know what I should do.
movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and they get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a suit suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to stand for the Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, but the kids are not really their public <unk>
They do a phenomenal job when we teach girls how to defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend ourselves from <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to go up in classic classic after classical each one of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the two men who raised a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year finally came out.
I recommend all of you, it's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when it came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the test for <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's still <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the film, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women speak to each other at some point in film?
Their conversations are about something more than the guy who just <unk>  Right? Thank you.  Thank you --  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> an idea of consensus that is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> isn't the test for <unk>
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the designers to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 films, more popular, how many of them believe they have protagonists of them.
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women we have chosen for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what it was.
In the United States, one in the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass training.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think I think is there is a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are these <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very <unk> statistical statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools in our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that I would have to do, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> -- yeah, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our children who have a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the box, is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite cartoon character was like, you know what I was going to do.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're expert.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories when I tell my <unk> Go and struggle and just more stories where their work looked like is to join a team, maybe a team that's led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked it was to look at the <unk> of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was invited to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a nearly 3,000 miles of length next to <unk>
And my sea satisfaction had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place sitting in the eastern Mississippi of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the naked eye, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process it using it using color color, suddenly the place looks like pink pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the Ottoman Empire.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Roman there was this great renaissance of the ancient art -- architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles, but somewhere within this huge continuous <unk>
This area is huge, it's about about <unk> per mile.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to try and find the equivalent of the <unk> the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes of <unk> and using gloves <unk>
So we use NASA data for NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians doing <unk> <unk> you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we're looking for layers of human thinking.
Five feet down, under a thick layer of processor we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a occupation of occupation of several hundred years that date back from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what proves that there was a jewelry shop.
This might seem like it's not too much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future.
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share the knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So as I think, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually happen in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
Now let's put a group of obese <unk> in bikes.
They're competing on a bicycle <unk> and they go in the direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of the gate of your house.
There are bikes that are flying everywhere, wheels that go on on their side, the wheelchair that they end up in places -- <unk> the threshold threshold.
And to the lobby, the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, and the light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
You're waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you talk about.
You can feel your blue fur, by making it tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you can see that it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on the side and trained their living room.
So in the room, and doing maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over his middle range, singing <unk> -- I read -- One more <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow way and from the oven. It comes to you -- the Man of the <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the hands, jumping into you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different men and a few different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> <unk> just once.
<unk> the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
I read whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could relate to more quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a guy named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition is that they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old industrial techniques, invented a half a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that he used <unk> to memorize their speakers, and that <unk> used to memorize <unk> <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English man, but a little <unk> told me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards and live in national television.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange trip to me.
And I ended up happening most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it that I had a problem of <unk> is awesome.
It was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We went a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, it was a number of treaties on the memory writing over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
And one of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not a thing as rare as you can find today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have changed our modern world, but they have changed.
We have changed, and I would say that they have changed the cognitive <unk>
As we have no need to remember, sometimes we have to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of a <unk> memory idea, and <unk> is this intellectual competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is the skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a bunch of researchers from University College London invited a research group to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're even smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference that a really interesting difference between the brains of the memory champions and the problems of control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them on an MRI machine, they <unk> their brains while they <unk> numbers, faces and form of snow, they found that on the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different than others.
They were actually <unk> or they looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is running as an armed race where each year appears to have a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize them in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques that are used at the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates a <unk> <unk> as the paradox of <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then you ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
Let's tell me what <unk>
The person who told her that his name is Baker it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who told her work is <unk>
Same word, different ability to <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the very Baker, and it doesn't really mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to it.
With all the other memories that dance for your head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> white <unk>
They have <unk>
They worked well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we got that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to make this goes back a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired as as entertainment, because before before, if I wanted to give a very good party, it didn't take a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon he was, the <unk> room was <unk>
We will save everyone.
But not only killed them all -- but it shattered the bodies into <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had sitting every day.
I took the family of my hand <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What they <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less, and that is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you tell them that I would tell me that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to make them very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to say who was sitting on the horse speaker brown or brown stuff in your <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy one, and the more crazy one, you know, <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from memory, in the same way that I would have done it, if you had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely <unk> and crazy image to help you remember the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they came in in the kitchen, and the fourth issue they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year and have some friends to help them remember it.
So it's like the speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for word, that will be confused but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of space terms.
The phrase <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got involved with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> <unk>
I mean, it's kind of like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before I sit at the New York Times simply trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What actually is about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- so you know, <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a few security glasses covered with tape leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered in a year before, and I had the idea that he could be, in a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and <unk> phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. They work that work.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of the memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> gift but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of the <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
We put a kind of deep processing, a kind of full attention that most of you can't be <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
So this is how things become <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what I <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence of <unk> or <unk> -- not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in front of us, we will be so <unk> that we didn't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned from first hand that there are incredible memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex topic, so it just <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from Bell Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time watching the TV, so every time I was going to go from my room to the toilet, everyone would see me, and every time I went back, and I would go back in a towel -- everyone would see.
And I was like this.
It was funny, insecure and hated it.
I had that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those feelings, those emotions I felt -- that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, or division of zones, but of those connections, emotional connections that feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like this, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded in architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines it in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it so being based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that the architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We used it in the 19th century to build museums in art.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, frozen front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and the governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> has this round thing, columns, red brick -- that they leave <unk> what is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have much to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other library, it looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, reading and sharing.
So what is possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works as the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the forms of life.
<unk> we gave us <unk> and we <unk> so we move away from the people.
All black, this is <unk> you believe that we feel very good, but we're dead around because we have no choice.
We have to go to the other side and go back to connect with these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experiment with <unk> and we are going to swing the pendulum back forward, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Very hard.
So we zoom in to the 1980s, and we started to bring these symbols.
They took the story back in the other direction.
We take those shapes we know like and <unk>
<unk> neon and we added a bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we made them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made out of glass.
The shapes were <unk> they won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became the columns.
The <unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time on commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own fantasies <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, because they are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we share memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making the story again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques -- and we find ourselves with new <unk> a different ways that they would stand against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is completely <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public and public were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these shapes and wild and radical how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is going to happen around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these ways.
The same thing did they did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the back of the back of the new University of home country with other star architects.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these very few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how do they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked into the next village to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
Technology technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't look very much time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, 100 buildings before I know if what I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to be <unk> <unk> because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, as far as you get in both extreme extremes -- and you actually have the difference between innovation and a symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started getting and shared in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a middle of communication, because these are not just images of a building, because these are not just images of a building, as a building made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when we upload these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building had been built today, first of all, <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, what might a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you, there's no answer to what a library can be a library today.
Let's be a part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and you're not an audience who doesn't have to have something that has not seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means the <unk> one of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions.
This is the end of the story of architecture, and it means the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
And this means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what it must be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the ways that will produce.
That means the buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve for a sports or for <unk> or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> East <unk> and raising half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, is no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more and more <unk> buildings, and more friendly.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite place.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there is a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they form it way to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we form our kids, and the step in the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does this very cool way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives himself those ugly kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and it made me think, When stopped doing this?
How do we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 and it lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, it just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, in spite of his mom tells you all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or fellow school people say, you don't know who believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks for others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a healthy healthy teenager, which gets these answers in one of the stages of their life most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that's never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This turns out that it's always always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of liking people that have and the kinds of reviews that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is actually rigged to <unk>
What is the most prominent in life of someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news stories right now.
<unk> <unk> they continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people do?
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be healthy individuals.
But in a <unk> culture, we're teaching our children spending more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of every other aspect of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capability, their studies and other aspects begin to be hurt.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and how they taxpayers society and developing labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> debates in the middle of the classroom, because they don't want to call attention for your physical <unk>
One of the five are not <unk> at all during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the testing season, if you don't think you see you good enough -- specifically enough, if you don't believe that you're serious enough, you have a lower note on the average of your fellow who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, America and China.
And you know, regardless of what these young people actually weigh these young.
So, for it to be very clear, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
The lower self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are doing fewer physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they engage in more diet not healthy that they can bring them into a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all for all of this for what they make more altruistic decisions like alcohol and drug consumption and <unk> behavior, aesthetics, sexual sexual activity, and without protection and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are <unk> again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to a job interview when they don't feel secure with the way you can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what is that <unk>
So let's make this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that many <unk> TV programs, without realizing it -- the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only going to have a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key <unk> The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of these things are starting to be critical points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each one of us to take on the problem and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
It is challenging the current status of how women are seen and said in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians on <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and reviews that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions, and not in their appearance.
And let me ask yourself, When was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow to the valuing their entire person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put the people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
Just to make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the great screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you have never been <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have on your mind?
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two seats at the distance. What would it mean for her if it was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, and he would tell him not to have a long legs, <unk> even more skinny, more skinny, more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were to <unk> this, and we can unlock his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is holding up to us.
But let's get our children the truth.
You know, the way you see that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they do feel.
We took the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of age today, they become agents of insurance change in the same morning.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League <unk> <unk>
At <unk> I was initially impressed by innocent but being prisoner for other <unk> and in the company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans are <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the northern bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't happen.
Later on, it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who had a <unk> with a loving American <unk> between the two they did everything possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims -- they get to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact with it not a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every single human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> their convictions that think that we have to use all the means possible for everybody to live like them.
A few months before his arrest he sat down with me and explained that in the last weekends he was and he and some friends, had been going to work by shooting at Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was monitoring by the FBI.
When my father touched me my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a son.
All of all, the comment gave you a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what it was so funny.
You see in me, the same level of destruction, my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to put them up with 700 pounds of explosives in the <unk> parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a blast that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times -- that instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was a time to pack and get to another city.
As I was always me the face of the class with often it was <unk>
<unk> secret to my identity to avoid being the white <unk> but to be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on house reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I haven't developed social skills, to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was raised opera to judge people, with <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that we put to test my thinking, was during the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- like I had been <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids that we had done, was Jewish was Jewish age.
It took several days out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I was very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life had been made me to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found people with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of the life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all the gay people were bad enough.
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in an show, and I could see that many of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a <unk> I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat kind, and exactly the way I would like to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I've taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what is going to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart made it be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that the race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure, <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration may come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that she conserving in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, someday, who is trying to bring the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which although I was encouraged by this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones. For the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to speak against those <unk> acts of rejection of my father's actions.
With this simplicity simplicity I put here as a proof that violence is not an inherent of any religion or race, which kids don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projects in your minds.
It's an amazing movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a <unk> voice.
The <unk> heart is you who experience everything seriously.
This film is the flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There is nothing to get it more directly.
So at least I know I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have, what we have to make to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science, by nature, is an objective successful.
<unk> by nature, is subjective things.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, we had that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real explosion, a blooming of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search of correlations correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work I did Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience will answer some questions that we want to explain to consciousness questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they <unk>
But in a sense, that's the easy problems.
<unk> to the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, I don't go on the real central mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors -- how do they operate the <unk> how the <unk> work -- how they adapt and adapt to living organisms are all questions about how they actually work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and function of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we figure out how we speak, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have to say.
I'm a <unk> a heart.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works for a long time, was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we were <unk> at this point.
We have a wonderful string chain, so cool -- we get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
So we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think our consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that the <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem for consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal subjective film includes sort of an illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions, brain behaviors, and so you study everything that needs to need <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time we have it, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like the gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they're considered principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th 19th century, it discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, mass law, and so he applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, half the logical question, you have to <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect the awareness with other fundamental concepts, space, the space, the mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want to want fundamental laws so simple that we could get it into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we could do it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs -- mice, the <unk> even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has a degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or that they <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of anxiety when you think about "Oh, always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling -- boom! some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How do someone think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something fundamental.
If it's <unk> like space, the time and the mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for the different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes out of the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we think of thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
It's always processing information, there's awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, consciousness is complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
So something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of how information integration is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it is not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of processing information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a middle degree of information integration, just quite significant, degree of consciousness -- quite important.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, whales, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is lower, but it's not zero either.
In the theory of <unk> there will still be a different level of the zero.
It actually brings a fundamental law of the <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but you don't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire coming out of the <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that you put fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness isn't found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, vision <unk> has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that I had to have consciousness, then it should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get very hungry.
I think if you think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the ethics of development systems and smart computers and the <unk> ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the collective consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk -- at this moment we have a TED consciousness, an internal movie for this full TED group, different from the internal movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a second of the second that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness, we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path toward a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night at the morning.
But I think we will finally be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an underwater profile of education.
I went to school, I got my friends, my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community reward.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful, but there's a obvious problem.
She was actually no <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, he had good notes. After the school, I had a underground, <unk> in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Some years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class, 11 <unk> studies, a boy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will your <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people on the wheels, they talk about things <unk> at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experienced experiences with disability like inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the <unk> of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- I sort of <unk> what I do in this wheels, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something <unk> A very, very <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes it happen.
It's not something wrong and not make a <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more to this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl drawing with a pencil with held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with <unk> <unk> legs.
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call the <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would have the disability in the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, it's really bad for me, it might be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking to you strange -- to express that you believe that I am <unk> or a source of inspiration, and this is happening before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was excited about getting up the morning and remembering my own name.
These images, these images, those images we have with disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's make a few things.
But the things we <unk> are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disability because of the society we live with because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with it.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of your ability as you do it, and that's what happens with kids from those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a <unk> <unk> it says as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because we have sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by <unk>
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability all over time.
But I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that get me over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to upload your mobile phone on the battery of your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we were going to, and we <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us life hard.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is bad -- the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles with a stretch of ladders has never done a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen, I'm not going to have the subtitles for the <unk> people.
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and make a positive attitude to convert all those books to <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't consider anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we're not going to have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are excited about the bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 degree school, is not a bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
Disability does not make us <unk> but question what you think you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see is <unk> reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think they really think they think in "Minority Report" and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because reality needs to change our lives both like the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
And let me experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, and to know what is going to run by the game of <unk> to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of us, <unk> trying to hide it with all his being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's give you some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the shell, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
Just a moment. Let's get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the soccer field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> at the University of Washington.
<unk> of <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with the <unk>
You want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be your favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, and how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why why I'm going to show you, with this video.
Man: Ah, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man in a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a
When I could be <unk> running through the <unk> pulling the ball back into the middle of the network?
What's their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers -- for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when the <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to make <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore was put on a <unk> to his <unk> in the field so he played faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to make it up.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put in the <unk> in the <unk> of the field and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to their group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
It is a strategy.
You just go out the field and they react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate losing games.
If you lose parties, you just like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But reality reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your form of playing the game.
How would you do here?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium -- having a view from the high people to the bottom.
You also get information from the sensors of the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have an information <unk>
This <unk> the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for <unk>
It's also to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
So imagine that you're the field.
They took the ball.
It was going to be open to an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you goes to <unk> but <unk> but the <unk> system.
<unk> the area of protection.
Another <unk> you would tell you that there's an open cost.
You get the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land, though, the receptor sees it in its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something to create a massive emotion on the game.
I will make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, right?
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's use it just as bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much this technology is for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of the <unk>
How much this technology is for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than Post-it notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is close.
The questions we do, the choices we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, from us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the country was <unk> the south end of the southern County <unk> which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known for its beautiful <unk> San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an engineer head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will bring them into another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so the each of it is released from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every <unk> of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is <unk> the bones, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, usually <unk> in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that that <unk> this method of suicide will realize the death of the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except for about the two towers, there are 32 inches in parallel to the bridge.
So this is where most people have to be able to take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this photo last year while this young man was talking to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service at those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We have come a long way since then.
Today, collective veterans and psychologists train the new official
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on June 23, last year by getting a call of a possible suicide subject sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with an Golden Gate enforcement officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up there two times before the New Jersey to try to kill themselves from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You know, don't open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was the hope.
And then Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and he was.
This guy kind and very smart guy in New Jersey had just taken away from life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I suppose when I was talking to them, didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had their order.
<unk> damage to suicide affect a lot of people.
I asked you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do we find?
What do you say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't you get <unk> or tell you to the person you know how it feels like it, because you probably won't.
It's just there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> in the front person can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs of <unk> despair, believing things are terrible and they never go to <unk> -- to believe that there is nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I think you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
He never came there.
I called the <unk> <unk> and I <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been <unk> without having a real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the courage that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his child took that day, and also the courage to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a possible suicide reader on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
<unk> my motorbikes on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, they crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
And for the next half and the next half the next half and the next half and the next half of his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back to this lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin looked at it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was what he did that he did, and gave the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "You <unk>
And I stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Spanish mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give you a <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of the March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I read Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
I really struggled with you, <unk> <unk>
And in the end, she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General San Francisco Hospital that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I knew I had to get it out.
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've ever found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather killed himself with a poison.
That act, despite the end of his own grief, gave me a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide does.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is only one of three things: sleep, drug drug or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and <unk> around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved involved, just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
And during that time, I got my hand back in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "Hey, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And we <unk>
<unk> absolutely nasty.
I want to tell you, though, that most of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second they get from side to the end of the ground they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must work on to be done.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you're not, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question you ask you, how do you tell you about that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone -- I'm not alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, and I think we got it, you get it, you know, <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of the skin, or the beliefs around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, my story.
I think this mystery is called the revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my genital appearance
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, and I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always have that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to make it happen.
gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that really, it's more complex and mystery as well.
Because of my success, I never would ask me to share my story, not because I thought to be what I'm a bad thing, but why the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accepts me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> I was the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a wonderful beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever involved in the <unk>
He told me that if I was <unk> it was <unk> from <unk> and wardrobe and I won that night, I won in a bath, I won in <unk> and I was <unk> in a <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was <unk> of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mother who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that I was passed on my drawing of the green card that I could go to the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like traveling and being a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you <unk> the United States and change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was going to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's funny in some of the most rural cities to perform the most sophisticated sophisticated and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to do the surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me to be the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think in this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but he <unk> he sent his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November we make a global <unk> for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that there is no longer any more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
You will do it you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> first, thank you for all my <unk>
My own network of support, to my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have found myself -- and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't take it, he would take my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call my mom and say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other not. It's just identity of gender, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all gave us a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the issue that sometimes that process will not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to do -- and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many societies, and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for your daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they went to their efforts in 2011, when they were <unk> the Social Peace Prize, became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at human history, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when you're born a girl, your birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, not by his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes up, gives your <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> a parent.
And a mother would get a lot to be a child.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, the first daughter, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just a suffering, but the daughter. The newly <unk> daughter, <unk> when it grows, too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you have home and school disappear to his brothers.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
You can <unk>
Can you play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes back in your adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you have to ban your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if they took the code of that <unk> honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption code -- not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more standard of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and according to the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly -- even if they don't.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson from his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter like this.
But when I <unk> all of them were men, and I got my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came, when she was four and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention the gate of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One <unk> means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the form of a Canadian basis, and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters and his daughters, thought it had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
He encouraged them to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all of these good values in my school and girls alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I showed you the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of involvement in women in all social and social activities.
Hundreds of schools came apart.
Girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have those people who kill and <unk> when you speak for their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a daily basis for the BBC in the BBC, the BBC, was offered to the New York Times documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful.
It was <unk> like a <unk> across the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't stand for his campaign and the October nine of 2012, was shot in <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, and he gave my ear to my wife -- <unk> <unk> so she passed my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please stop you."
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the truth of the truth, for the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were going to be a lot to me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and I had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never got <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to make it good. Please don't stop.
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to be able to resist in the most difficult moments, and I'm very pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when you don't have his task.
You fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special about my <unk> which has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
I didn't do that.
He didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google group, where I had had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google visualization -- but all the work that I'm talking about here today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined the brain science, I did it before I joined my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you give it to a brain operation.
You're still like smart or not?
It's not going to be intelligent to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to make, more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mixing it out of chemicals, and trying to get them to work with life.
I've been saved by a little bit of it.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try and get the dose of the dose, because there is really no one map of that to say it in <unk>
I started to test with different mixes and I was shocked by seeing how little changes on the dose were dramatically my sense of who I was me, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
So a particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried dose and chemical dose and chemical <unk> for a man of <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past, I've met various kinds of guys like this, or maybe some <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot to be able to fix a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience I gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do -- since then I have better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> think about images, and that became my key point of reference to how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me is very simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I came up to find the point right and I have lots of great mental <unk> and really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a movie director was able to use their imagination just to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups leading in neuroscience.
Both of them were using MRI technology, MRI and functional resonance to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows you the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows you the scan of the brain of that same individual while looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by the contents of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they <unk> their brains to create a great pool of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as they were <unk> a new <unk>
So the computer, using just the brain information in the scan of the scanning thing, to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This got us <unk>
We're very close to that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you can imagine that same image, you believe in the brain the same <unk>
This is done with the brain scanning brain systems available today, and their resolution was a thousand times in the last years.
Now we need to increase the resolution for a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do that.
One is to open up the skull and you put the electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new projection techniques for images, including me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets -- just offered little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than big, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI is to make real magnets -- right?
But most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> of ingenious solutions and shining and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> of FM and FM matter.
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field, they are able to be able to see magnetic patterns structured structured <unk> frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing processing patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split in layers of our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the other of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to <unk> our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have few options more to open this door.
Anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet maybe you can tell some person for the first time she loves her or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to do in life.
It will all become a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've experienced and have gone out of that closet a universal thing.
It is fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I would be slope by the <unk> of my <unk> and I would have <unk> the head -- I would usually ask me a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid.
And it would look like a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I would take my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would get it inside.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where a child was about three and 10 years, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that the next time I would say something.
So I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was prepared and I was about to go into the women's issues at the table --   I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
The dates from Gloria <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took it down and I went down and I went down to my back a little girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> one girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I took it back back, again, I got <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a bit <unk>
I have the short hair like the one guy, and I saw a child, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a pink pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite ninja is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- "Oh, no. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how a feels like a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from you or you or your yours.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons why to go out of my closet it was more difficult to go out of your head, but this is the <unk> The difficult thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has left on banking banking is more difficult to say that it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I story is more difficult to tell your five year-old child that you are going to be <unk>
There's no most difficult thing, there's only the tough thing.
We need to stop classifying what is hard to do with what it is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel safe or at least more security than the side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what they are made walls, a closet not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse tail, a dress and high shoes.
I wasn't militant <unk> to fight any child in four years that would fit the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet my backyard gay, and the move only a muscle is the scariest thing that ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was on my sister <unk>
It was the first time that a lot of guests were invited to know that I was gay, and when I was doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and finally came to a place where my parents' friends, people who knew me was years.
And after I speak a moment, one of the women in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes for desperately to show his support, to make me know that I was on my hand, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic ones that you want.
That's how the hard conversations are still not my strong point.
Ask anybody with anybody who I have to have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but you understand that what it involves out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee was not <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must be able to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you say your parents who might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never happen for that.
And some of them can be injured safe, by sure, so they have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence -- an productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> which is the question of if a machine might think it's as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When he <unk> <unk> wrote this thing as a critique of the computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth or the Earth or intelligence of Earth, but that they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly large lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept on the Earth, that it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to a certain point in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet.
And that's why I claim this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, which <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> specifically for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will increase the diversity of future future.
Finally, in <unk> robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked together, for several years ago: There is an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for intelligence for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever saw.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices with a <unk> force with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an imminent time time.
In a nutshell, to intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
Their intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the choices open.
And so having this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Do we have the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have a trend in the existence of intelligent beings for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if smart behavior is not only related to the production of entropy production, but it actually arises from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy production in any system that you meet inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, everything without being used to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate with opposite ends of the opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic development and a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, this is successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly running and keeping the network very well connected.
This is the same capacity of the network of the network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see here, organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to broaden the world the way from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable into defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a series of simulated actions, in a series of simulated actions, by successfully increasing the assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have vast applications in finance, and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of the flow of one equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> play -- there was always the concept that if we had smart machines -- there would be a rebellion <unk>
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we have had the concept of stand-up rebellion in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then they will try and take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all of the possible future is a fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that intelligence can actually be able to get directly away from taking control instead of being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for goal.
They often ask me, "How is it that you're looking for goals to be <unk> of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, it's this: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've extended a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
<unk> mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space telescope that measures the faint light intensity of the stars when planets go in front of them, and they block a little bit of that light coming in.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there is among them and their teenage star.
In <unk> this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At the same time, this gives you clues about if these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014, was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since recently are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused a global scale to the global scale of our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a scientist and the weather, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you how much planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that is shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface looking for clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
<unk> now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But despite the fact that all these images are <unk> they remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still on <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> places, and higher than the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> for our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried about this enthusiasm for the fifth of Mars and other planets to bring with a great and sad way, and the implication of some of the one that Mars will be waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is really <unk> the Earth.
So I like the <unk> exploration, I'm deep into this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for <unk> to humanity is like figuring out the captain of the Titanic to tell us that the captain of the Titanic will actually have place later in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for ocean exploration, and the earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They're closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas, and we may be able to satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, "Do I realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to be able to consider to continue to live between stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we could build this development.
It's arrogant to think about the colonization of it, to save us from ourselves, but the <unk> and the <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to apply to the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would get my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining room, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and they were all <unk>
I thought I would call a <unk> at least my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but it's sure that no more expensive than a <unk> at the night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, I've been very stuck.
I <unk> a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> who increases your heart rhythm, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could do, systems that could put in place, which was going to happen.
Or at least if bad things happen, the probability is going to be a total catastrophe as well.
So I started thinking about that, but even a month after my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared him with me who had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, <unk> a place for things that are <unk>
This sounds very common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a follow-up track of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the female tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose your car, <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook with the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For his <unk> a particular drawer.
For your reading glasses, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and you're <unk> with it all the things that will always be there when you <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards on your credit cards, if you could drive your drive, <unk> <unk> for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your brain.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
